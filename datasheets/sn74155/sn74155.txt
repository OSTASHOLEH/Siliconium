These monolithic transistor - transistor - logic ( TTL ) cir- cuits feature dual 1 - line - to - 4 - line demultiplexers with individual strobes and common binary - address inputs in a single 16 - pin package . When both sections are enabled by the strobes , the common binary - address inputs sequentially select and route associated input data to the appropriate output of each section . The individual strobes permit activating or inhibiting each of the 4 - bit sections as desired . Data applied to input 1C is inverted at its outputs and data applied at 2C is not inverted through its outputs . The inverter fol- lowing the 1C data input permits use as a 3 - to - 8 - line decoder or 1 - to - 8 - line demultiplexer without external gating . Input clamping diodes are provided on all of these circuits to minimize transmission - line effects and simplify system design .
