These shift registers consist of five R - S master - slave flip - flops connected to perform parallel - to - serial or serial - to - parallel conversion of binary data . Since both inputs and outputs for all flip - flops are accessible , parallel - in / parallel - out or serial - in / serial - out operation may be performed . All flip - flops are simultaneously set to a low output level by applying a low - level voltage to the clear input E7 PRE 8 while the preset is inactive ( low ) . Clearing is independent of the level of the clock input The register may be parallel loaded by using the clear input in conjunction with the p stages to low output levels , data to be loaded is applied to the individual preset inpu high - level load pulse is applied to the preset enable input . Presetting like clearing is indepe input .
