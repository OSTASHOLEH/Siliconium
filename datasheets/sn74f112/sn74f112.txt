The SN74F112 contains two independent J-K
negative-edge-triggered flip-flops. A low level at
the preset (PRE) or clear (CLR) inputs sets or
resets the outputs regardless of the levels of the
other inputs. When PRE and CLR are inactive
(high), data at the J and K inputs meeting the setup
time requirements is transferred to the outputs on
the negative-going edge of the clock pulse. Clock
triggering occurs at a voltage level and is not
directly related to the rise time of the clock pulse.
Following the hold-time interval, data at the J and
K inputs may be changed without affecting the
levels at the outputs. The SN74F112 can perform
as a toggle flip-flop by tying J and K high.
The SN74F112 is characterized for operation from
0°C to 70°C.
