The 74ALS273 has eight edge-triggered D-type flip-flops with
individual D inputs and Q outputs. The common buffered clock (CP)
and master reset (MR) inputs load and reset all flip-flops
simultaneously.
The register is fully edge-triggered. The state of each D input, one
setup time before the Low-to-High clock transition, is transferred to
the corresponding flip-flopâ€™s Q output.
All outputs will be forced Low independently of clock or data inputs
by a Low voltage level on the MR input.
The device is useful for applications where the true output only is
required and the CP and MR are common to all flip-flops.
