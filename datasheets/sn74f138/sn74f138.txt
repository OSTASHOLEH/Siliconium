The ′F138 is designed to be used in

high-performance memory-decoding or data-
routing applications requiring very short

propagation delay times. In high-performance
memory systems, these decoders can be used to
minimize the effects of system decoding. When
employed with high-speed memories utilizing a
fast enable circuit, the delay times of this decoder
and the enable time of the memory are usually
less than the typical access time of the memory.
This means that the effective system delay
introduced by the decoder is negligible.
The conditions at the binary-select inputs and the
three enable inputs select one of eight output
lines. Two active-low and one active-high enable
inputs reduce the need for external gates or
inverters when expanding. A 24-line decoder can
be implemented without external inverters and a 32-line decoder requires only one inverter. An enable input can
be used as a data input for demultiplexing applications.
The SN54F138 is characterized for operation over the full military temperature range of –55°C to 125°C. The
SN74F138 is characterized for operation from 0°C to 70°C.
