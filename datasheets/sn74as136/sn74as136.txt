These devices contain four independent
Exclusive-OR gates with open-collector outputs.
They perform the Boolean functions
Y = A ⊕ B = AB + AB in positive logic.
A common application is a true/complement
element. If one of the inputs is low, the other input
will be reproduced in true form at the output. If one
of the inputs is high, the signal on the other input
will be reproduced inverted at the output.

The SN54ALS136 and SN54AS136 are charac-
terized for operation over the full military

temperature range of –55°C to 125°C. The
SN74ALS136 and SN74AS136 are characterized
for operation from 0°C to 70°C.
