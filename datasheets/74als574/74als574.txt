These octal D-type edge-triggered flip-flops
feature 3-state outputs designed specifically for
bus driving. They are particularly suitable for
implementing buffer registers, I/O ports,
bidirectional bus drivers, and working registers.
The eight flip-flops enter data on the low-to-high
transition of the clock (CLK) input. The
SN74ALS575A, SN54AS575, and SN74AS575
may be synchronously cleared by taking the clear
(CLR) input low.
The output-enable (OE) input does not affect
internal operations of the flip-flops. Old data can
be retained or new data can be entered while the
outputs are in the high-impedance state.
The SN54ALS574B, SN54AS574, and
SN54AS575 are characterized for operation over
the full military temperature range of –55°C to
125°C. The SN74ALS574B, SN74ALS575A,
SN74AS574, and SN74AS575 are characterized
for operation from 0°C to 70°C.
