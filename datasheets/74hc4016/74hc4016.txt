The 74HC/HCT4016 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS
devices and are pin compatible with the “4016” of the

“4000B” series. They are specified in compliance with
JEDEC standard no. 7A.
The 74HC/HCT4016 have four independent analog
switches (transmission gates).
Each switch has two input/output terminals (Yn, Zn) and an
active HIGH enable input (En). When En is connected to
VCC, a low bidirectional path between Yn and Zn is
established (ON condition). When En is connected to
ground (GND), the switch is disabled and a high
impedance between Yn and Zn is established (OFF
condition).
Current through a switch will not cause additional
VCC current provided the voltage at the terminals of the
switch is maintained within the supply voltage range;
VCC >> (VY, VZ) >> GND. Inputs Yn and Zn are electrically
equivalent terminals.
