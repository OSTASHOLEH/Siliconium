The 74HC/HCT139 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS devices
and are pin compatible with low power Schottky TTL
(LSTTL). It is specified in compliance with JEDEC
standard no. 7A.
The 74HC/HCT139 are high-speed, dual 2-to-4 line
decoder/multiplexers. This device has two independent
decoders, each accepting two binary weighted inputs
(nA0 and nA1) and providing four mutually exclusive active
LOW outputs (nY0 to nY3). Each decoder has an active
LOW enable input (nE).
When nE is HIGH, every output is forced HIGH. The
enable can be used as the data input for a 1-to-4
demultiplexer application.
The “139” is identical to the HEF4556 of the HE4000B
family.
