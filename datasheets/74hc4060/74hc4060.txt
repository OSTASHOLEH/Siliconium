The 74HC/HCT4060 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS
devices and are pin compatible with “4060” of the “4000B”
series. They are specified in compliance with JEDEC
standard no. 7A.
The 74HC/HCT4060 are 14-stage ripple-carry
counter/dividers and oscillators with three oscillator

terminals (RS, RTC and CTC), ten buffered outputs (Q3 to
Q9 and Q11 to Q13) and an overriding asynchronous
master reset (MR).
The oscillator configuration allows design of either RC or
crystal oscillator circuits. The oscillator may be replaced by
an external clock signal at input RS. In this case keep the
other oscillator pins (RTC and CTC) floating.
The counter advances on the negative-going transition of
RS. A HIGH level on MR resets the counter (Q3 to Q9 and
Q11 to Q13 = LOW), independent of other input conditions.
In the HCT version, the MR input is TTL compatible, but
the RS input has CMOS input switching levels and can be
driven by a TTL output by using a pull-up resistor to VCC.
