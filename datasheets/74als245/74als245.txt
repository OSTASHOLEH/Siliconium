This advanced low power Schottky device contains 8 pairs

of 3-STATE logic elements configured as octal bus trans-
ceivers. These circuits are designed for use in memory,

microprocessor systems and in asynchronous bidirectional
data buses. Two way communication between buses is
controlled by the (DIR) input. Data transmits either from the
A bus to the B bus or from the B bus to the A bus. Both the
driver and receiver outputs can be disabled via the (G)

enable input which causes outputs to enter the high imped-
ance mode so that the buses are effectively isolated.
