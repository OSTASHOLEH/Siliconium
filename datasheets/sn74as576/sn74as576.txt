These octal D-type edge-triggered flip-flops
feature 3-state outputs designed specifically for
bus driving. They are particularly suitable for
implementing buffer registers, I/O ports,
bidirectional bus drivers, and working registers.
These flip-flops enter data on the low-to-high
transition of the clock (CLK) input.
The output-enable (OE) input does not affect
internal operations of the flip-flops. Old data can
be retained or new data can be entered while the
outputs are disabled.
The SN54ALS576B and SN54AS576 are
characterized for operation over the full military
temperature range of –55°C to 125°C. The
SN74ALS576B, SN74ALS577A, and
SN74AS576 are characterized for operation from
0°C to 70°C.
