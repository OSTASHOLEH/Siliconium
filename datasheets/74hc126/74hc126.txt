The 74HC/HCT126 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS devices and are pin compatible with low power Schottky TTL (LSTTL).
They are specified in compliance with JEDEC standard no. 7A.
The HC/HCT126 are four non-inverting buffer/line drivers with 3-state outputs. The 3-state outputs (nY) are controlled by
the output enable input (nOE). A LOW at nOE causes the outputs to assume a HIGH impedance OFF-state.
The “126” is identical to the “125” but has active HIGH enable inputs.
