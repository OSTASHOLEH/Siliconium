The 74HC/HCT4051 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS
devices and are pin compatible with the “4051” of the

“4000B” series. They are specified in compliance with
JEDEC standard no. 7A.
The 74HC/HCT4051 are 8-channel analog
multiplexers/demultiplexers with three digital select inputs
(S0 to S2), an active LOW enable input (E), eight
independent inputs/outputs (Y0 to Y7) and a common
input/output (Z).
With E LOW, one of the eight switches is selected (low
impedance ON-state) by S0 to S2. With E HIGH, all
switches are in the high impedance OFF-state,
independent of S0 to S2.
VCC and GND are the supply voltage pins for the digital
control inputs (S0 to S2, and E). The VCC to GND ranges
are 2.0 to 10.0 V for HC and 4.5 to 5.5 V for HCT. The
analog inputs/outputs (Y0 to Y7, and Z) can swing between
VCC as a positive limit and VEE as a negative limit.
VCC − VEE may not exceed 10.0 V.
For operation as a digital multiplexer/demultiplexer, VEE is
connected to GND (typically ground).
