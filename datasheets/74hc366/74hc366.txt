The 74HC/HCT366 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS devices
and are pin compatible with low power Schottky TTL
(LSTTL). They are specified in compliance with JEDEC
standard no. 7A.

The 74HC/HCT366 are hex inverting buffer/line drivers
with 3-state outputs. The 3-state outputs (nY) are
controlled by the output enable inputs (OE1, OE2).
A HIGH on OEn causes the outputs to assume a high
impedance OFF-state.
The ”366” is identical to the “365” but has inverting outputs.
