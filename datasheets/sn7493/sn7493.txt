Each of these monolithic counters contains four master - slave flip - flops and additional gating to provide a divide - by - two counter and a three- stage binary counter for which the count cycle length is divide - by - five for the ' 90A and ' LS90 , divide - by - six for the ' 92A and LS92 , and the divide - by - eight for the ' 93A and ' LS93 . All of these counters have a gated zero reset and the ' 90A and ' LS90 also have gated set - to - nine inputs for use in BCD nine's complement applications . To use their maximum count length ( decade , divide - by - twelve , or four - bit binary ) of these counters , the CKB input is connected to the QA output . The input count pulses are applied to CKA input and the outputs are as described in the appropriate function table . A symmetrical divide - by - ten count can be obtained from the ' 90A or ' LS90 counters by connecting the QD output to the CKA input and applying the input count to the CKB input which gives a divide - by- ten square wave at output QA
