The 74ALS373 is an octal transparent latch coupled to eight 3-State
output devices. The two sections of the device are controlled
independently by enable (E) and output enable (OE) control gates.
The data on the D inputs is transferred to the latch outputs when the
enable (E) input is High. The latch remains transparent to the data
input while E is High, and stores the data that is present one setup
time before the High-to-Low enable transition.
The 3-State output buffers are designed to drive heavily loaded
3-State buses, MOS memories, or MOS microprocessors.
The active-Low output enable (OE) controls all eight 3-State buffers
independent of the latch operation. When OE is Low, latched or
transparent data appears at the output.
When OE is High, the outputs are in High impedance “off” state,
which means they will neither drive nor load the bus.
The 74ALS374 is an 8-bit edge triggered register coupled to eight
3-State output buffers. The two sections of the device are controlled
independently by clock (CP) and output enable (OE) control gates.
The register is fully edge triggered. The state of the D input, one
setup time before the Low-to-High clock transition is transferred to
the corresponding flip-flop’s Q output.
The 3-State output buffers are designed to drive heavily loaded
3-State buses, MOS memories, or MOS microprocessors.
The active-Low output enable (OE) controls all eight 3-State buffers
independent of the register operation. When OE is Low, the data in
the register appears at the outputs. When OE is High, the outputs
are in High impedance “off” state, which means they will neither
drive nor load the bus.
