These high - speed monolithic counters consist of four d - c coupled master - slave flip - flops which are internally interconnected to provide either a divide - by - two and a divide - by - five counter ( SN54176 , SN74176 ) or a divide - by - two and a divide - by - eight counter ( SN54177 , SN74177 ) . These counters are fully programmable ; that is , the outputs may be preset to any state by placing a low on the count / load input and entering the desired data at the data inputs . The outputs will change to agree with the data inputs independent of the state of the clocks . These counters may also be used as 4 - bit latches by using the count / load input as the strobe and entering data at the data inputs . The outputs will directly follow the data inputs when the count / load is low , but will remain unchanged when the count / load is high and the clock inputs are inactive . These high - speed counters will accept count frequencies of O to 35 megahertz at the clock - 1 input and 0 to 17.5 megahertz at the clock - 2 input . During the count operation , transfer of information to the outputs occurs on the negative - going edge of the clock pulse . The counters feature a direct clear which when taken low sets all outputs low regardless of the states of the clocks .
