The ' 190 , LS190 , 191 , and LS191 are synchronous , reversible up / down counters having a complexity of 58 equivalent gates . The " 191 and LS191 are 4 - bit binary counters and the 190 and 15190 are BCD counters . Synchronous operation is provided by having all flip- flops clocked simultaneously so that the outputs change coincident with each other when so instructed by the steiring logic . This mode of operation eliminates the output counting spikes normally associated with asyn chronous ( ripple clock ) counters . flip - flops are triggen
