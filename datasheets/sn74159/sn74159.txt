Each of these monolithic , 4 - line - to - 16 line decoders utilizes TTL circuitry to decode four binary - coded inputs into one of sixteen mutually exclusive open - collector outputs when both the strobe inputs , G1 and G2 , are low . The demultiplexing function is performed by using the 4 input lines to address the output line , passing data from one of the strobe inputs with the other strube input low . When either strobe input is high , all outputs are high . These demultiplexers are ideally suited for implementing MOS memory decoding or for interfacing with discrete memory address drivers . For ultra - high - speed applications , the SN54 $ 138 / SN745138 or SN54S139 / SN745139 is recommended . These circuits are fully compatible for use with most other TTL circuits . Input clamping diodes are provided to minimize transmission - line effects and thereby simplify system design . Input buffers are used to lower the fan - in requirement to only one normalized Series 54/74 load . A fan - out to 10 normalized Series 54/74 loads in the low- level state is available from each of the sixteen outputs . Typical power dissipation is 170 mW . The SN54159 is characterized for operation over the full military temperature range of 55 C to 125 C , the SN74159 is characterized for operation from 0 ° C to 70 ° C .
