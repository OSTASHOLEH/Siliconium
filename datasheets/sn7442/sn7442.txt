These monolithic BCD - to - decimal decoders / drivers consist of eight inverters and ten four - input NAND gates . The inverters are connected in pairs to make BCD input data available for decoding by the NAND gates . Full decoding of valid BCD input logic ensures that all outputs remain off for all invalid binary input conditions . These decoders feature TTL inputs and high- performance , n - p - n output transistors designed for use as indicator / relay drivers or as open - collector logic- circuit drivers . Each of the high - breakdown output transistors ( 30 volts ) will sink up to 80 milliamperes of current . Each input is one normalized Series 54/74 load . Inputs and outputs are entirely compatible for use with TTL logic circuits , and the outputs are compatible for interfacing with most MOS Integrated circuits . Power dissipation is typically 215 milliwatts .
