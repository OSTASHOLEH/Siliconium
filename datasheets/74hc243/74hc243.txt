The 74HC/HCT243 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS devices
and are pin compatible with low power Schottky TTL
(LSTTL). They are specified in compliance with JEDEC
standard no. 7A.

The 74HC/HCT243 are quad bus transceivers featuring
non-inverting 3-state bus compatible outputs in both send
and receive directions.
They are designed for 4-line asynchronous 2-way data
communications between data buses.
The output enable inputs (OEA and OEB) can be used to
isolate the buses.
The “243” is similar to the “242” but has non-inverting (true)
outputs.
