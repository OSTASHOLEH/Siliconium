These octal buffers/drivers are designed
specifically to improve both the performance and
density of 3-state memory address drivers, clock
drivers, and bus-oriented receivers and
transmitters. When these devices are used with
the ’ALS241, ’AS241A, ’ALS244, and ’AS244A
devices, the circuit designer has a choice of
selected combinations of inverting and
noninverting outputs, symmetrical active-low
output-enable (OE) inputs, and complementary
OE and OE inputs. These devices feature high
fan-out and improved fan-in.
The -1 version of SN74ALS240A is identical to the
standard version, except that the recommended
maximum IOL for the -1 version is 48 mA. There is
no -1 version of the SN54ALS240A.
