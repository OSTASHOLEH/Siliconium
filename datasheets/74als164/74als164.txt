The 74ALS164 is an 8-bit edge-triggered shift register with serial
data entry and an output from each of the eight stages. Data is
entered serially through one of two inputs (Dsa, Dsb); either input
can be used as an active-high enable for data entry through the
other input. Both inputs must be connected together or an unused
input must be tied High.
Data shifts one place to the right on each Low-to-high transition of
the clock (CP) input, and enters into Q0 the logical AND of the two
data inputs (Dsa, Dsb) that existed one setup time before the rising
edge. A Low level on the Master reset (MR) input overrides all other
inputs and clears the register asynchronously, forcing all outputs
Low.
