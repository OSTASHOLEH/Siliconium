These 8 - bit shift registers feature gated serial inputs and an asynchronous clear . The gated serial inputs ( A and B ) permit complete control over incoming data as a low at either input inhibits entry of the new data and resets the first flip - flop to the low level at the next clock pulse . A high - level input enables the other input which will then determine the state of the first flip - flop . Data at the serial inputs may be changed while the clock is high or low , but only information meeting the setup - time re- quirements will be entered . Clocking occurs on the low- to - high - level transition of the clock input . All inputs are diode - clamped to minimize transmission - line effects . The SN54164 and SN54LS164 are characterized for operation over the full military temperature range of -55 ° C to 125 ° C .
