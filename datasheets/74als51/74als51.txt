The 74ALS51 is fabricated using a 2μm 40V Bipolar
process. The device consists of two independent

combinations of gates each performing the logic AND-OR-
INVERT function. The IC integrates one 2-wide 3-input

gates and one 2-wide 2-input gates each performing
Boolean functions 1Y = (1A•1B•1C) + (1D•1E•1F) and
2Y = (2A•2B) + (2C•2D) respectively. All inputs are
protected against ESD and excess voltage transients.
