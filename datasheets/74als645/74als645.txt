The 74ALS645A is an octal transceiver featuring non-inverting
3-State bus compatible outputs in both transmit and receive
directions. The device features an output enable (OE) input for easy
cascading and transmit/receive (R/T) input for direction control.
The 74ALS645A-1 is the same as the 74ALS645A except that both
ports sink 48mA within the Â±5% VCC range.
