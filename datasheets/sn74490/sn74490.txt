The ' 46A , 47A , and LS47 feature active - low outputs designed for driving common - anode LEDs or incandescent indicators directly . The '48 , ' LS48 , and ' LS49 feature active - high outputs for driving lamp buffers or common - cathode LEDs . All of the circuits except ' LS49 have full ripple - blanking input / output controls and a lamp test input . The ' LS49 circuit incorporates a direct blanking input . Segment identification and resultant displays are shown below . Display patterns for BCD input counts above 9 are unique symbols to authenticate input conditions . The ' 46A , ' 47A , 48 , LS47 , and LS48 circuits incorporate automatic leading and / or trailing - edge zero - blanking control ( RBI and RBO ) . Lamp test ( LT ) of these types may be performed at any time when the BI / RBO node is at a high level . All types ( including the '49 and ' LS49 ) contain an overriding blanking input ( B ) , which can be used to control the lamp intensity by pulsing or to inhibit the outputs . Inputs and outputs are entirely compatible for use with TTL logic outputs
