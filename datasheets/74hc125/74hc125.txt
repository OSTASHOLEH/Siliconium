The 74HC/HCT125 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS devices and are pin compatible with low power Schottky TTL (LSTTL).
They are specified in compliance with JEDEC standard no. 7A.
The 74HC/HCT125 are four non-inverting buffer/line drivers with 3-state outputs. The 3-state outputs (nY) are controlled
by the output enable input (nOE). A HIGH at nOE causes the outputs to assume a HIGH impedance OFF-state.
The “125” is identical to the “126” but has active LOW enable inputs.
