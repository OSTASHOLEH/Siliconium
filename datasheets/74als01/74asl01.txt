74ALS00 provides x4 independent 2-input NAND gates
performing the Boolean function Y = A • B or Y = A + B.
The device is fabricated using a 1.5μm 40V Bipolar
process. Internal circuitry comprises of 3 stages and
includes buffered outputs for high noise immunity and
stability. All inputs are equipped with protection circuits
against static discharge and transient excess voltage.
