These devices contain four independent 2 - input Exclusive - OR gates . They perform the Boolean functions Y = A e B = AB + AB in positive logic . A common application is as a true / complement element . If one of the inputs is low , the other input will be reproduced in true form at the output . If one of the inputs is high , the signal on the other input will be reproduced inverted at the output . The SN5486 , 54LS86A , and the SN54S86 are characterized for operation over the full military temperature range of -55 째 C to 125 째 C . The SN7486 , SN74LS86A , and the SN74S86 are characterized for operation from 0 째 C to 70 째 C .
