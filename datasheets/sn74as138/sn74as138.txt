The ′ALS138A and ′AS138 are 3-line to 8-line

decoders/demultiplexers designed for high-
performance memory-decoding or data-routing

applications requiring very short propagation
delay times. In high-performance systems, these
devices can be used to minimize the effects of
system decoding. When employed with
high-speed memories with a fast enable circuit,
the delay times of the decoder and the enable time
of the memory are usually less than the typical
access time of the memory. The effective system
delay introduced by the Schottky-clamped system
decoder is negligible.
The conditions at the binary-select (A, B, and C)
inputs and the three enable (G1, G2A, and G2B)
inputs select one of eight output lines. Two
active-low and one active-high enable inputs
reduce the need for external gates or inverters when expanding. A 24-line decoder can be implemented without
external inverters and a 32-line decoder requires only one inverter. An enable input can be used as a data input
for demultiplexing applications.
The SN54ALS138A and SN54AS138 are characterized for operation over the full military temperature range
of –55°C to 125°C. The SN74ALS138A and SN74AS138 are characterized for operation from 0°C to 70°C.
