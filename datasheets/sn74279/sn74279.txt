The ' 279 offers 4 basic 5 - R flip - flop latches in one 16 - pin , 300 - mil package . Under conventional opera- tion , the 5 - R inputs are normally held high . When the 5 input is pulsed low , the Q output will be set high . When R is pulsed low , the Q output will be reset low . Normally , the S - R inputs should not be taken low si- multaneously . The Q output will be unpredictable in this condition .
