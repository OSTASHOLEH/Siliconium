These 4 - bit registers feature parallel and serial inputs , parallel outputs , mode control , and two clock inputs . The registers have three modes of operation : Parallel ( broadside ) load Shift right ( the direction QA toward QD ) Shift left ( the direction Qp toward QA ) Parallel loading is accomplished by applying the four bits of data and taking the mode control input high . The data is loaded into the associated flip - flops and appears at the outputs after the high - to - low transition of the clock - 2 input . During loading , the entry of serial data is inhibited . Shift right is accomplished on the high - to - low transi- tion of clock 1 when the mode control is low ; shift left is accomplished on the high - to - low transition of clock 2 when the mode control is high by connecting the output of each flip - flop to the parallel input of the previous flip - flop ( Qp to input C , etc. ) and serial data is entered at input D. The clock input may be applied commonly to clock 1 and clock 2 if both modes can be clocked from the same source . Changes at the mode control input should normally be made while both clock inputs are low ; however , conditions described in the last three lines of the function table will also ensure that register contents are protected .
