These monolithic quadruple two - input multiplexers with storage provide essentially the equivalent functional capabilities of two separate MSI functions ( SN54157 / SN74157 or SN54LS157 / SN74LS157 and SN54175 / SN74175 or SN54LS175 / SN74LS175 ) in a single 16 - pin package . When the word - select input is low , word 1 ( A1 , B1 , C1 , D1 ) is applies to the flip - flops . A high input to word select will cause the selection of word 2 1A2 , B2 , C2 , D2 ) . The selected word is clocked to the output terminals on the negative - going edge of the clock pulse . Typical power dissipation is 195 milliwatts for the 298 and 65 milliwatts for the LS298 . SN54298 and SN54LS298 are characterized for operation over the full military temperature range of -55 C to 125 C : SN74298 and SN74LS298 are characterized for operation from 0 ° C to 70 ° C .
