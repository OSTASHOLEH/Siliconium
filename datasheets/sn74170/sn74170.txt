The ' 170 and ' LS170 MSI 16 - bit TTL register files incorporate the equivalent of 98 gates . The register file is organized as 4 words of 4 bits each and separate on - chip decoding is provided for addressing the four word locations to either write - in or retrieve data . This permits simultaneous writing into one location and reading from another word location . Four data inputs are available which are used to supply the 4 - bit word to be stored . Location of the word is determined by the write address inputs A and B in conjunction with a write - enable signal . Data applied at the inputs should be in its true form . That is , if a high - level signal is desired from the output , a high level is applied at the data input for that particular bit location . The latch inputs are arranged so that new data will be accepted only if both internal address gate inputs are high . When this condition exists , data at the D input is transferred to the latch output . When the write - enable input , Gw , is high , the data inputs are inhibited and their levels can cause no change in the information stored in the internal latches . When the read - enable input , GR , is high , the data outputs are inhibited and remain high .
