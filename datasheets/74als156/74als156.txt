The 74ALS157 is a quad 2-input multiplexer which selects 4 bits of
data from one of two sources under the control of a common select
input (S). The enable input (E) is active when Low. When E is High,
all of the outputs (Yn) are forced Low regardless of all other input
conditions.
Moving data from two registers to a common output bus is a typical
use of the 74ALS157. The state of the select input determines the
particular register from which data comes.
The device is the logic implementation of 4-pole, 2-position switch
where the position of the switch is determined by the logic levels
supplied to the select input. The 74ALS158 is similar but has
inverting outputs (Yn).
