Each circuit functions as a 4 - input NAND gate , but because of the Schmitt action , it has different input threshold levels for positive ( VT + ) and for negative going ( VT- ) signals . These circuits are temperature - compensated and can be triggered from the slowest of input ramps and still give clean , jitter - free output signals . The SN54136 and SN54LS136 are characterized for oper- ation over the full military temperature range of -55 째 C to 125 째 C . The SN74136 and SN74LS136 are character- ized for operation from 0 째 C to 70 째 C .
