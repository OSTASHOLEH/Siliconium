The SN74CBT162292 is a 12-bit 1-of-2
high-speed TTL-compatible FET multiplexer/
demultiplexer. The low on-state resistance of the
switch allows connections to be made with
minimal propagation delay.
When the select (S) input is low, port A is
connected to port B1, and RINT is connected to
port B2. When S is high, port A is connected to port
B2, and RINT is connected to port B1.
The A-port inputs/outputs include equivalent 25-Î©
series resistors to reduce overshoot and
undershoot.
