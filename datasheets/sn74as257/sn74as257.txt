These data selectors/multiplexers are designed
to multiplex signals from 4-bit data sources to
4-output data lines in bus-organized systems. The
3-state outputs do not load the data lines when the
output-enable (OE) input is at a high logic level.
The SN54ALS257A and SN54ALS258A are
characterized for operation over the full military
temperature range of –55°C to 125°C. The
SN74ALS257A, SN74ALS258A, SN74AS257,
and SN74AS258 are characterized for operation
from 0°C to 70°C.
