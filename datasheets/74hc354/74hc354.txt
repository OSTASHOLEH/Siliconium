The 74HC/HCT354 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS devices
and are pin compatible with low power Schottky TTL

(LSTTL). They are specified in compliance with JEDEC
standard no. 7A.
The 74HC/HCT354 data selectors/multiplexers contain full
on-chip binary decoding, to select one-of-eight data
sources. The data select address is stored in transparent
latches that are enabled by a LOW on the latch enable
input (LE).
The transparent 8-bit data latches are enabled when the
active LOW data enable input (E) is LOW. When the output
enable input OE1 = HIGH, OE2 = HIGH or OE3 = LOW,
the outputs go to the high impedance OFF-state.
Operation of these output enable inputs does not affect the
state of the latches.
