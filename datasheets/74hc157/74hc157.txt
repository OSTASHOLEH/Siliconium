The 74HC/HCT157 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS devices
and are pin compatible with low power Schottky TTL
(LSTTL). They are specified in compliance with JEDEC
standard no. 7A.
The 74HC/HCT157 are quad 2-input multiplexers which
select 4 bits of data from two sources under the control of
a common data select input (S). The four outputs present
the selected data in the true (non-inverted) form. The
enable input (E) is active LOW. When E is HIGH, all of the
outputs (1Y to 4Y) are forced LOW regardless of all other
input conditions.

Moving the data from two groups of registers to four
common output buses is a common use of the “157”. The
state of the common data select input (S) determines the
particular register from which the data comes. It can also
be used as function generator.
The device is useful for implementing highly irregular logic
by generating any four of the 16 different functions of two
variables with one variable common.
The “157” is the logic implementation of a 4-pole,
2-position switch, where the position of the switch is
determined by the logic levels applied to S.
The logic equations are:
1Y = E.(1l1.S + 1l0.S)
2Y = E.(2l1.S + 2l0.S)
3Y = E.(3l1.S + 3l0.S)
4Y = E.(4l1.S + 4l0.S)
The “157” is identical to the “158” but has non-inverting
(true) outputs.
