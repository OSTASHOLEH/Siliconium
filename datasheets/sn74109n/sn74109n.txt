These devices contain two independent J - K positive- edge - triggered flip - flops . A low level at the preset or clear inputs sets or resets the outputs regardless of the levels of the other inputs . When preset and clear are in- active ( high ) , data at the J and K inputs meeting the setup time requirements are transferred to the outputs on the positive - going edge of the clock pulse . Clock triggering occurs at a voltage level and is not directly related to the rise time of the clock pulse . Following the hold time interval , data at the J and K inputs may be changed without affecting the levels at the outputs . These versatile flip - flops can perform as toggle flip - flops by grounding K and tying J high . They also can perform as D - type flip - flops if J and K are tied together . The SN54109 and SN54LS109A are characterized for operation over the full military temperature range of -55 째 C to 125 째 C . The SN74109 and SN74LS109A are characterized for operation from 0 째 C to 70 째 C
