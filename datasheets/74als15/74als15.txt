The 74ALS151 is a logic implementation of a single 8-position
switch with the switch position controlled by the state of three select
(S0, S1, S2) inputs. True (Y) and complementary (Y) outputs are
both provided.
The enable (E) is active-Low. When E is High, Y output is Low and
the Y output is High regardless of all other inputs.
