The 74HC/HCT368 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS devices
and are pin compatible with low power Schottky TTL
(LSTTL). They are specified in compliance with JEDEC
standard no. 7A.

The 74HC/HCT368 are hex inverting buffer/line drivers
with 3-state outputs. The 3-state outputs (nY) are
controlled by the output enable inputs (1OE, 2OE).
A HIGH on nOE causes the outputs to assume a high
impedance OFF-state.
The “368” is identical to the “367” but has inverting outputs.
