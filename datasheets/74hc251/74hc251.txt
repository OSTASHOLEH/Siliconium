The 74HC/HCT251 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS devices
and are pin compatible with low power Schottky TTL
(LSTTL). They are specified in compliance with JEDEC
standard no. 7A.

The 74HC/HCT251 are the logic implementations of
single-pole 8-position switches with the state of three
select inputs (S0, S1, S2) controlling the switch positions.
Assertion (Y) and negation (Y) outputs are both provided.
The output enable input (OE) is active LOW.
