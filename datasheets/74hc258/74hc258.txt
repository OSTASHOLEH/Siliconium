The 74HC/HCT258 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS devices
and are pin compatible with Low power Schottky TTL
(LSTTL). They are specified in compliance with JEDEC
standard no. 7A.
The 74HC/HCT258 have four identical 2-input multiplexers
with 3-state outputs, which select 4 bits of data from two
sources and are controlled by a common data select
input (S).
The data inputs from source 0 (1I0 to 4I0) are selected
when input S is LOW and the data inputs from source 1
(1I1 to 4I1) are selected when S is HIGH.

Data appears at the outputs (1Y to 4Y) in inverted form
from the select inputs.
The ‘258’ is the logic implementation of a 4-pole, 2-position
switch, where the position of the switch is determined by
the logic levels applied to S. The outputs are forced to a
high impedance OFF-state when OE is HIGH.
