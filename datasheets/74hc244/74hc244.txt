The MC54/74HC244A is identical in pinout to the LS244. The device
inputs are compatible with standard CMOS outputs; with pullup resistors,
they are compatible with LSTTL outputs.
This octal noninverting buffer/line driver/line receiver is designed to be
used with 3–state memory address drivers, clock drivers, and other
bus–oriented systems. The device has noninverting outputs and two
active–low output enables.
The HC244A is similar in function to the HC240A and HC241A.
