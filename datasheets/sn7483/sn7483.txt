These improved full adders perform the addition of two 4 - bit binary numbers . The sum ( Σ ) outputs are provided for each bit and the resultant carry ( C4 ) is obtained from the fourth bit . These adders feature full internal look ahead across all four bits generating the carry term in ten nanoseconds typically . This provides the system designer with partial look - ahead performance at the economy and reduced package count of a ripple - carry implementation . The adder logic , including the carry , is implemented in its true form meaning that the end - around carry can be accomplished without the need for logic or level inversion . Designed for medium - speed applications , the circuits utilize transistor - transistor logic that is compatible with most other TTL families and other saturated low - level logic families . Series 64 and 54LS circuits are characterized for operation over the full military temperature range of —-55 ° C to 125 ° C , and Series 74 and 74LS circuits are characterized for operation from 0 ° C to 70 ° C .
