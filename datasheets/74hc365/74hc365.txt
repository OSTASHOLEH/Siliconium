The 74HC/HCT365 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS devices
and are pin compatible with low power Schottky TTL
(LSTTL). They are specified in compliance with JEDEC
standard no. 7A.

The 74HC/HCT365 are hex non-inverting buffer/line
drivers with 3-state outputs. The 3-state outputs (nY) are
controlled by the output enable inputs (OE1, OE2).
A HIGH on OEn causes the outputs to assume a high
impedance OFF-state.
The “365” is identical to the “366” but has non-inverting
outputs.
