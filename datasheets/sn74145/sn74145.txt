These monolithic BCD - to - decimal decoder / drivers con- sist of eight inverters and ten four - Input NAND gates . The inverters are connected in pairs to make BCD input data available for decoding by the NAND gates . Full decoding of valid BCD input logic ensures that all out- puts remain off for all invalid binary Input conditions . These decoders feature high - performance , n - p - n output transistors designed for use as indicator / relay drivers or as open - collector logic - circuit drivers . Each of the high- breakdown output transistors ( 15 volts ) of the SN54145 , SN74145 , or SN74LS145 will sink up to 80 milliamperes of current . Each input is one Series 54/74 or Series 54LS / 74LS standard load , respectively . Inputs and outputs are entirely compatible for use with TTL or DTL logic circuits , and the outputs are compatible for in- terfacing with most MOS integrated circuits . Power dissipation is typically 215 milliwatts for the ' 145 and 35 milliwatts for the ' LS145 .
