The '76 contains two independent J - K flip - flops with individual J - K , clock , preset , and clear inputs . The '76 is a positive - edge - triggered flip- flop . J - K input is loaded into the master while the clock is high and transferred to the slave on the high - to - low transition . For these devices the J and K inputs must be stable while the clock is high . The ' LS76A contain two independent negative- edge - triggered flip - flops . The J and K inputs must be stable one setup time prior to the high- to - low clock transition for predicatble operation . The preset and clear are asynchronous active low inputs . When low they override the clock and data inputs forcing the outputs to the steady state levels as shown in the function table , The SN5476 and the SN54LS76A are characterized for operation over the full military temperature range of 55 째 C to 125 째 C . The SN7476 and the SN74LS76A are characterized for operation from 0 째 C to 70 째 C .
