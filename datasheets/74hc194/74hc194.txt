The 74HC/HCT194 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS devices
and are pin compatible with low power Schottky TTL
(LSTTL). They are specified in compliance with JEDEC
standard no. 7A.
The functional characteristics of the 74HC/HCT194 4-bit
bidirectional universal shift registers are indicated in the
logic diagram and function table. The registers are fully
synchronous.
The “194” design has special features which increase the
range of application. The synchronous operation of the
device is determined by the mode select inputs (S0, S1).
As shown in the mode select table, data can be entered

and shifted from left to right (Q0 → Q1 → Q2, etc.) or, right
to left (Q3 → Q2 → Q1, etc.) or parallel data can be
entered, loading all 4 bits of the register simultaneously.
When both S0 and S1 are LOW, existing data is retained in
a hold (“do nothing”) mode. The first and last stages
provide D-type serial data inputs (DSR, DSL) to allow
multistage shift right or shift left data transfers without
interfering with parallel load operation.
Mode select and data inputs are edge-triggered,
responding only to the LOW-to-HIGH transition of the
clock (CP). Therefore, the only timing restriction is that the
mode control and selected data inputs must be stable one
set-up time prior to the positive transition of the clock
pulse.
The four parallel data inputs (D0 to D3) are D-type inputs.
Data appearing on the D0 to D3 inputs, when S0 and S1 are
HIGH, is transferred to the Q0 to Q3 outputs respectively,
following the next LOW-to-HIGH transition of the clock.
When LOW, the asynchronous master reset (MR)
overrides all other input conditions and forces the Q
outputs LOW.
The “194” is similar in operation to the “195” universal shift
register, with added features of shift-left without external
connections and hold (“do nothing”) modes of operation.
