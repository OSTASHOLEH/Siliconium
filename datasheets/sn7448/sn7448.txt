The ' 46A , ' 47A , 48 , LS47 , and LS48 circuits incorporate automatic leading and / or trailing - edge zero - blanking control ( RBI and RBO ) . Lamp test ( LT ) of these types may be performed at any time when the BI / RBO node is at a high level . All types ( including the '49 and ' LS49 ) contain an overriding blanking input ( B ) , which can be used to control the lamp intensity by pulsing or to inhibit the outputs . Inputs and outputs are entirely compatible for use with TTL logic outputs . The SN54246 / SN74246 and 247 and the SN54LS247 / SN74LS247 and LS248 compose the 6 and the 9 with tails and were designed to offer the designer a choice between two indicator fonts .
