The 74ALS175 is a quad, edge-triggered D-type flip-flops with
individual D inputs and both Q and Q outputs. The common buffered
clock (CP) and master reset (MR) inputs load and reset (clear) all
flip-flops simultaneously.
The register is fully edge-triggered. The state of each D input, one
setup time before the Low-to-High clock transition is transferred to
the corresponding flip-flopâ€™s Q output.
All Q outputs will be forced Low independent of clock or data inputs
by a Low voltage level on the MR input. The device is useful for
applications where both true and complement outputs are required,
and the clock and master reset are common to all storage elements.
