The 74HC/HCT03 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS devices
and are pin compatible with low power Schottky TTL
(LSTTL). They are specified in compliance with JEDEC
standard no. 7A.

The 74HC/HCT03 provide the 2-input NAND function.
The 74HC/HCT03 have open-drain N-transistor outputs,
which are not clamped by a diode connected to VCC. In
the OFF-state, i.e. when one input is LOW, the output
may be pulled to any voltage between GND and VOmax.
This allows the device to be used as a LOW-to-HIGH or
HIGH-to-LOW level shifter. For digital operation and
OR-tied output applications, these devices must have a
pull-up resistor to establish a logic HIGH level.
