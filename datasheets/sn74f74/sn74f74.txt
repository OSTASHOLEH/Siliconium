These devices contain two independent positive-
edge-triggered D-type flip-flops. A low level at the

preset (PRE) or clear (CLR) inputs sets or resets
the outputs regardless of the levels of the other
inputs. When PRE and CLR are inactive (high),
data at the data (D) input meeting the setup time
requirements is transferred to the outputs on the
positive-going edge of the clock pulse. Clock
triggering occurs at a voltage level and is not
directly related to the rise time of the clock pulse.
Following the hold-time interval, data at the
D input may be changed without affecting the
levels at the outputs.
The SN54F74 is characterized for operation over
the full military temperature range of –55°C to
125°C. The SN74F74 is characterized for
operation from 0°C to 70°C.
