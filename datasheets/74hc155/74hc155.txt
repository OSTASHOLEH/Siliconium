The M54/74HC155 is a high speed CMOS DUAL 2-
TO-4 LINE DECODER fabricated in silicon gate
C2
MOS technology.
It has the same high speed performance of LSTTL
combined with true CMOS low power consumption.

It features dual 1-TO-4 line demultiplexers with indi-
vidual strobe inputs (1G and 2G), individual data in-
puts (1C and 2C) and common binary address

inputs (A and B).
When both decoders are enabled bythestrobes, the
inverted output of 1C data and non-inverted output
of 2C data will be brought to the select output pins
of each sections. A 1-TO-8 line demultiplexer can
also be easily built up by providing a data signal to
both 1C and 2C inputs ; the output order from the
msb is 1Y3, 1Y2, 1Y1, 1Y0, 2Y3, 2Y2, 2Y1, 2Y0.
This device can be used as a 2-to-4 line decoder or
a 3-to-8 line decoder when 1C is held high and 2C
is held low.
All inputs are equipped with protection circuits

against static discharge and transient excess volt-
age.
