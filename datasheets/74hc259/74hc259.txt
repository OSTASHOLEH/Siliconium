The 74HC/HCT259 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS devices
and are pin compatible with low power Schottky TTL
(LSTTL). They are specified in compliance with JEDEC
standard no. 7A.
The 74HC/HCT259 are high-speed 8-bit addressable
latches designed for general purpose storage applications
in digital systems. The “259” are multifunctional devices

capable of storing single-line data in eight addressable
latches, and also 3-to-8 decoder and demultiplexer, with
active HIGH outputs (Q0 to Q7), functions are available.
The “259” also incorporates an active LOW common reset
(MR) for resetting all latches, as well as, an active LOW
enable input (LE).
The “259” has four modes of operation as shown in the
mode select table. In the addressable latch mode, data on
the data line (D) is written into the addressed latch. The
addressed latch will follow the data input with all
non-addressed latches remaining in their previous states.
In the memory mode, all latches remain in their previous
states and are unaffected by the data or address inputs.
In the 3-to-8 decoding or demultiplexing mode, the
addressed output follows the state of the D input with all
other outputs in the LOW state. In the reset mode all
outputs are LOW and unaffected by the address (A0 to A2)
and data (D) input. When operating the “259” as an
addressable latch, changing more than one bit of address
could impose a transient-wrong address. Therefore, this
should only be done while in the memory mode. The mode
select table summarizes the operations of the “259”.
