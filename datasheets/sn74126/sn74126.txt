These bus buffers feature three-state outputs
that, when enabled, have the low impedance
characteristics of a TTL output with additional
drive capability at high logic levels to permit
driving heavily loaded bus lines without external
pullup resistors. When disabled, both output
transistors are turned off, presenting a
high-impedance state to the bus so the output will
act neither as a significant load nor as a driver. The
’125 and ’LS125A devices’ outputs are disabled
when G is high. The ’126 and ’LS126A devices’
outputs are disabled when G is low.
