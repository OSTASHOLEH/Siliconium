These bidirectional shift registers are designed to incorporate virtually all of the features a system designer may want in a shift register . The circuit contains 46 equivalent gates and features parallel inputs , parallel outputs , right - shift and left - shift serial inputs , operating - mode - control inputs , and a direct overriding clear line . The register has four distinct modes of operation , namely : Inhibit clock ( do nothing ) Shift right ( in the direction QA toward QD ) Shift left ( in the direction Op toward QA ) Parallel ( broadside ) load Synchronous parallel loading is accomplished by applying the four bits of data and taking both mode control inputs , SO and S1 , high . The data are loaded into the associated flip - flops and appear at the outputs after the positive transition of the clock input . During loading , serial data flow is inhibited . Shift right is accomplished synchronously with the rising edge of the clock pulse when SO is high and $ 1 is low . Serial data for this mode is entered at the shift - right data input . When SO is low and $ 1 is high , data shifts left synchronously and new data is entered at the shift - left serial input . Clocking of the shift register is inhibited when both mode control inputs are low . The mode controls of the SN54194 / SN74194 should be changed only while the clock input is high .
