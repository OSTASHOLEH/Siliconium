These devices contain two independent 4-input
positive-NAND gates. They perform the Boolean
functions Y = A • B • C • D or Y = A + B + C + D
in positive logic.
The SN54ALS20A and SN54AS20 are
characterized for operation over the full military
temperature range of –55°C to 125°C. The
SN74ALS20A and SN74AS20 are characterized
for operation from 0°C to 70°C.
