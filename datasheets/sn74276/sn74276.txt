These quadruple TTL J - K flip - flops incorporate a number of third - generation IC features that can simplify system design and reduce flip - flop package count by up to 50 % . They feature hysteresis at each clock input fully buffered outputs , and direct clear capability , and are presettable through a buffer that also features an input hysteresis loop . The negative- edge - triggering clocks are directly compatible with earlier Series 54/74 single and dual pulse - triggered flip - flops . These circuits can be used to emulate D or T - type flip - flops by hard - wiring the inputs , or to implement asychronous sequential functions . The SN54276 is characterized for operation over the full military temperature range of -55 째 C to 125 째 C ; the SN74726 is characterized for operation from 0 째 C to 70 째 C .
