The 74HC/HCT14 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS devices and are pin compatible with low power Schottky TTL (LSTTL).
They are specified in compliance with JEDEC standard no. 7A.
The 74HC/HCT14 provide six inverting buffers with Schmitt-trigger action. They are capable of transforming slowly
changing input signals into sharply defined, jitter-free output signals.
