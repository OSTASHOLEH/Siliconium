The 74ALS86 contain four independent 2-input Exclusive-OR gates.
A common application is a true/complement element. If one input is
held Low, the signal on the other input will be reproduced in true
form at the output. If one input is held High, the signal on the other
input will be reproduced inverted at the output.
