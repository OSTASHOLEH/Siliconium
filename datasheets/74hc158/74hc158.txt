The 74HC/HCT158 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS devices
and are pin compatible with low power Schottky TTL
(LSTTL). They are specified in compliance with JEDEC
standard no. 7A.
The 74HC/HCT158 are quad 2-input multiplexers which
select 4 bits of data from two sources and are controlled by
a common data select input (S). The four outputs present
the selected data in the inverted form. The enable input (E)
is active LOW.
When E is HIGH, all the outputs (1Y to 4Y) are forced
HIGH regardless of all other input conditions.

Moving the data from two groups of registers to four
common output buses is a common use of the “158”. The
state of S determines the particular register from which the
data comes. It can also be used as a function generator.
The device is useful for implementing highly irregular logic
by generating any four of the 16 different functions of two
variables with one variable common.
The ”158” is the logic implementation of a 4-pole,
2-position switch, where the position of the switch is
determined by the logic levels applied to S.
The logic equations for the output are:
1Y = E.(1l1.S + 1l0.S)
2Y = E.(2l1.S + 2l0.S)
3Y = E.(3l1.S + 3l0.S)
4Y = E.(4l1.S + 4l0.S)
The “158” is identical to the “157” but has inverting outputs.
