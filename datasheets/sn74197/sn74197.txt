These high - speed monolithic counters consist of four d - c coupled , master - slave flip - flops , which are internally interconnected to provide either a divide - by - two and a divide - by - five counter ( ' 196 , ' L $ 196 , ' S196 ) or a divide- by - two and a divide - by - eight counter ( ' 197 , ' LS197 , * S1971 . These four counters are fully programmable ; that is , the outputs may be preset to any state by placing a low on the count / load input and entering the desired data at the data inputs . The outputs will change to agree with the data inputs independent of the state of the clocks . During the count operation , transfer of information to the outputs occurs on the negative - going edge of the clock pulse . These counters feature a direct clear which when taken low sets all outputs low regardless of the states of the clocks . These counters may also be used as 4 - bit latches by us ing the count / load input as the strobe and entering data at the data inputs . The outputs will directly follow the data inputs when the count / load is low , but will remain unchanged when the count / load is high and the clock inputs are inactive . All inputs are diode clamped to minimize transmission- line effects and simplify system design . These circuits are compatible with most TTL logic families . Series 54 , 54LS , and 545 circuits are characterized for operation over the full military temperature range of -55 ° C to 125 ° C Series 74 , 74LS , and 745 circuits are characterized for operation from 0 ° C to 70
