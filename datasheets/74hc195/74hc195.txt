The 74HC/HCT195 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS devices
and are pin compatible with low power Schottky TTL
(LSTTL). They are specified in compliance with JEDEC
standard no. 7A.
The 74HC/HCT195 performs serial, parallel,
serial-to-parallel or parallel-to-serial data transfer at very
high speeds. The “195” operates on two primary modes:
shift right (Qo→Q1) and parallel load, which are controlled

by the state of the parallel load enable (PE) input. Serial
data enters the first flip-flop (Q0) via the J and K inputs
when the PE input is HIGH and shifted one bit in the
direction Q0 → Q1 → Q2 → Q3 following each
LOW-to-HIGH clock transition. The J and K inputs provide
the flexibility of the JK type input for special applications
and by tying the pins together, the simple D-type input for
general applications. The “195” appears as four common
clocked D flip-flops when the PE input is LOW.
After the LOW-to-HIGH clock transition, data on the
parallel inputs (D0 to D3) is transferred to the respective
Q0 to Q3 outputs. Shift left operation (Q3 → Q2) can be
achieved by tying the Qn outputs to the Dn-1 inputs and
holding the PE input LOW.
All parallel and serial data transfers are synchronous,
occurring after each LOW-to-HIGH clock transition.
There is no restriction on the activity of the J, K, Dn and
PE inputs for logic operation other than the set-up and
hold time requirements. A LOW on the asynchronous
master reset (MR) input sets all Q outputs LOW,
independent of any other input condition.
