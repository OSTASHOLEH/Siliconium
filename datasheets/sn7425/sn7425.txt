Each of these monolithic circuits contains eight master - slave flip - flops and additional gating to imple- ment . two individual four - bit counters in a single package . The ' 390 and ' LS390 incorporate dual divide - by - two and divide - by - five counters , which can be used to implement cycle lengths equal to any whole and / or cumulative multiples of 2 and / or 5 up to divide - by - 100 . When connected as a bi - quinary counter , the separate divide - by - two circuit can be used to provide symmetry ( a square wave ) at the final output stage . The ' 393 and ' LS393 each comprise two independent four - bit binary counters each having a clear and a clock input . N - bit binary counters can be implemented with each package providing the capability of divide - by - 256 . The ' 390 , ' LS390 , ' 393 , and LS393 have parallel outputs from each counter stage so that any submultiple of the input count frequency is available for system - timing signals . Series 54 and Series 54LS circuits are characterized for operation over the full military temperature range of - 55 ° C to 125 ° C
