The ′F541 octal buffer/line driver is ideal for driving
bus lines or buffering memory address registers.
The device features inputs and outputs on
opposite sides of the package to facilitate
printed-circuit-board layout.
The 3-state control gate is a 2-input AND gate with
active-low inputs so that if either output enable
(OE1 or OE2) input is high, all eight outputs are in
the high-impedance state.
The SN54F541 is characterized for operation over
the full military temperature range of –55°C to
125°C. The SN74F251 is characterized for
operation from 0°C to 70°C.
