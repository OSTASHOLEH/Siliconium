This 64 - bit active - element memory is a monolithic , high - speed , transistor - transistor logic ( TTL ) array of 64 flip - flop memory cells organized in a matrix to provide 16 words of four bits each . Each of the 16 words is addressed in straight binary with full on - chip decoding . The buffered memory inputs consist of four address lines , four data inputs , a write enable , and a memory enable for controlling the entry and access of data . The memory has open- collector outputs which may be wired - AND connected to permit expansion up to 4704 words of N - bit length without additional output buffering . Access time is typically 33 nanoseconds ; power dissipation is typically 375 milliwatts .
