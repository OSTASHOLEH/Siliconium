These 4 - bit registers feature parallel inputs , parallel outputs , J - K serial inputs , shift / load ( SH / LD ) control input , and a direct overriding clear . All inputs are buffered to lower the input drive requirements . The register has two modes of operation : Parallel ( broadside ) load Shift ( in the direction QA toward QD ) Parallel loading is accomplished by applying the four bits of data and taking SH / LD low . The data is loaded into the associated flip - flop and appears at the outputs after the positive transition of the clock input . During loading , serial data flow is inhibited . Shifting is accomplished synchronously when SH / LD is high . Serial data for this mode is entered at the J - K inputs . These inputs permit the first stage to perform as a J - K , D- , or T - type flip - flop as shown in the function table . The high - performance ' $ 195 , with a 105 - megahertz typical maximum shift - frequency , is particularly attrac- tive for very high - speed data processing systems . In most cases existing systems can be upgraded merely by using this Schottky - clamped shift register .
