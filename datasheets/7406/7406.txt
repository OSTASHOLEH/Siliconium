These TTL hex inverter buffers/drivers feature
high-voltage open-collector outputs for interfacing
with high-level circuits (such as MOS) or for
driving high-current loads (such as lamps or
relays), and also are characterized for use as
inverter buffers for driving TTL inputs. The
SN5406 and SN7406 have minimum breakdown
voltages of 30 V. The SN5416 and SN7416 have
minimum breakdown voltages of 15 V. The
maximum sink current is 30 mA for the SN5406
and SN5416, and 40 mA for the SN7406 and
SN7416.
