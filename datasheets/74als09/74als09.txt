These devices contain four independent 2-input
positive-AND gates. They perform the Boolean
functions Y = A • B or Y = A + B in positive logic.
The open-collector outputs require pullup
resistors to perform correctly. These outputs may
be connected to other open-collector outputs to
implement active-low wired-OR or active-high
wired-AND functions. Open-collector devices are
often used to generate higher VOH levels.
The SN54ALS09 is characterized for operation
over the full military temperature range of –55°C
to 125°C. The SN74ALS09 is characterized for
operation from 0°C to 70°C.
