These monolithic TTL circuits utlize D - type bistables to implement two independent four - bit latches in a single package . Each four - bit latch has an independent asynchronous clear input and a gated two - input enable circuit . When both enable inputs are low , the output levels will follow the data input levels . When either or both of the enable inputs are taken high , the outputs re- main at the last levels setup at the inputs prior to the low - to - high - level transition at the enable input ( s ) . After this , the data in- puts are locked out . The clear input is overriding and when taken low will reset all four outputs low regardless of the levels of the enable inputs . The SN54116 is characterized for operation over the full military temperature range of -55 째 C to 125 째 C ; the SN74116is characterized for operation from 0 째 C to 70 째 C .
