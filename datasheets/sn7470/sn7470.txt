These monolithic serial - in , serial - out , 8 - bit shift registers utilize transistor - transistor logic ( TTL ) circuits and are composed of eight R - S master - slave flip - flops , input gating , and a clock driver . Single - rail data and input control are gated through inputs A and B and an internal inverter to form the complementary inputs to the first bit of the shift register . Drive for the internal common clock line is provided by an inverting clock driver . This clock pulse inverter / driver causes these circuits to shift infor- mation one bit on the positive edge of an input clock pulse .
