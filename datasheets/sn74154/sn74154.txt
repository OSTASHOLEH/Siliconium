Each of these monolithic , 4 - line - to - 16 - line decoders utilizes TTL circuitry to decode four binary - coded inputs into one of sixteen mutually exclusive outputs when both the strobe inputs , G1 and G2 , are low . The demultiplexing function is performed by using the 4 in- put lines to address the output fine , passing data from one of the strobe inputs with the other strobe input low . When either strobe input is high , all outputs are high . These demultiplexers are ideally suited for implementing high - performance memory decoders . For ultra - high systems , SN54S138 / SN74 $ 138 and SN54S139 / SN74S139 are recommended . speed These circuits are fully compatible for use with most other TTL circuits . All inputs are buffered and input clamping diodes are provided to minimize transmission- line effects and thereby simplify system design . The SN54154 is characterized for operation over the full military temperature range of -55 째 C to 125 째 C . The SN74154 is characterized for operation from 0 째 C to 70 째 C .
