These octal buffers and line drivers are designed
specifically to improve both the performance and
density of 3-state memory address drivers, clock
drivers, and bus-oriented receivers and
transmitters. Taken together with the ′F241 and
′F244, these devices provide the choice of
selected combinations of inverting and
noninverting outputs, symmetrical OE (active-low
output-enable) inputs, and complementary OE
and OE inputs.
The ′F240 is organized as two 4-bit buffers/line
drivers with separate output enable (OE) inputs.
When OE is low, the device passes data from the
A inputs to the Y outputs. When OE is high, the
outputs are in the high-impedance state.
The SN74F240 is available in TI’s shrink
small-outline package (DB), which provides the
same I/O pin count and functionality of standard
small-outline packages in less than half the
printed-circuit-board area.
The SN54F240 is characterized for operation over
the full military temperature range of –55°C to
125°C. The SN74F240 is characterized for
operation from 0°C to 70°C.
