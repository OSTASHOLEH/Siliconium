The 74HC/HCT4066 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS
devices and are pin compatible with the “4066” of the
“4000B” series. They are specified in compliance with
JEDEC standard no. 7A.

The 74HC/HCT4066 have four independent analog
switches. Each switch has two input/output terminals (nY,
nZ) and an active HIGH enable input (nE). When nE is
LOW the belonging analog switch is turned off.
The “4066” is pin compatible with the “4016” but exhibits a
much lower “ON” resistance. In addition, the “ON”
resistance is relatively constant over the full input signal
range.
