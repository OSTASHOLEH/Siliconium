The 74HC/HCT107 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS devices
and are pin compatible with low power Schottky TTL
(LSTTL). They are specified in compliance with JEDEC
standard no. 7A.

The 74HC/HCT107 are dual negative-edge triggered
JK-type flip-flops featuring individual J, K, clock (nCP) and
reset (nR) inputs; also complementary Q and Q outputs.
The J and K inputs must be stable one set-up time prior to
the HIGH-to-LOW clock transition for predictable
operation.
The reset (nR) is an asynchronous active LOW input.
When LOW, it overrides the clock and data inputs, forcing
the Q output LOW and the Q output HIGH.
Schmitt-trigger action in the clock input makes the circuit
highly tolerant to slower clock rise and fall times.
