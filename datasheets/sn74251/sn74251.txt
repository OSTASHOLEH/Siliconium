These monolithic data selectors / multiplexers contain full on - chip binary decoding to select one - of - eight data sources and feature a strobe - controlled three- state output . The strobe must be at a low logic level to enable these devices . The three - state outputs per- mit a number of outputs to be connected to a com- mon bus . When the strobe input is high , both outputs are in a high - impedance state in which both the upper and lower transistors of each totem - pole output are off , and the output neither drives nor loads the bus significantly . When the strobe is low , the outputs are activated and operate as standard TTL totem - pole outputs . To minimize the possibility that two outputs will attempt to take a common bus to opposite logic levels , the output control circuitry is designed so that the average output disable time is shorter than the average output enable time . The SN54251 and SN74251 have output clamp diodes to attenuate reflections on the bus line .
