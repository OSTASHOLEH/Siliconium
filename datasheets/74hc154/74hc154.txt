The 74HC/HCT154 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS devices
and are pin compatible with low power Schottky TTL
(LSTTL). They are specified in compliance with JEDEC
standard no. 7A.

The 74HC/HCT154 decoders accept four active HIGH
binary address inputs and provide 16 mutually exclusive
active LOW outputs.
The 2-input enable gate can be used to strobe the decoder
to eliminate the normal decoding “glitches” on the outputs,
or it can be used for the expansion of the decoder.
The enable gate has two AND’ed inputs which must be
LOW to enable the outputs.
The “154” can be used as a 1-to-16 demultiplexer by using
one of the enable inputs as the multiplexed data input.
When the other enable is LOW, the addressed output will
follow the state of the applied data.
