This 10-bit flip-flop device features three-state
outputs designed specifically for driving highly
capacitive or relatively low-impedance loads. It is
particularly suitable for implementing wider buffer
registers, I/O ports, bidirectional bus drivers with
parity, and working registers. The ten flip-flops are
edge-triggered D-type flip-flops. On the positive
transition of the clock, the Q outputs on the
’AS1821 will be true.
A buffered output-control input can be used to
place the ten outputs in either a normal logic state
(high or low levels) or a high-impedance state. In
the high-impedance state the outputs neither load
nor drive the bus lines significantly. The
high-impedance state and increased drive provide
the capability to drive the bus lines in a
bus-organized system without need for interface
or pull-up components. The output control (OC)
does not affect the internal operation of the
flipflops. Old data can be retained or new data can
be entered while the outputs are in the
high-impedance state.
The SN74AS1821 is characterized for operation
from 0°C to 70°C.
