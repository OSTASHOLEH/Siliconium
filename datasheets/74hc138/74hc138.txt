The 74HC/HCT138 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS devices
and are pin compatible with low power Schottky TTL
(LSTTL). They are specified in compliance with JEDEC
standard no. 7A.

The 74HC/HCT138 decoders accept three binary
weighted address inputs (A0, A1, A2) and when enabled,
provide 8 mutually exclusive active LOW outputs (Y0 to
Y7).
The “138” features three enable inputs: two active LOW
(E1 and E2) and one active HIGH (E3). Every output will be
HIGH unless E1 and E2 are LOW and E3 is HIGH.
This multiple enable function allows easy parallel
expansion of the “138” to a 1-of-32 (5 lines to 32 lines)
decoder with just four “138” ICs and one inverter.
The ”138” can be used as an eight output demultiplexer by
using one of the active LOW enable inputs as the data
input and the remaining enable inputs as strobes. Unused
enable inputs must be permanently tied to their
appropriate active HIGH or LOW state.
The ”138” is identical to the “238” but has inverting outputs.
