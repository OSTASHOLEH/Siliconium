The 74HC/HCT175 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS devices
and are pin compatible with low power Schottky TTL
(LSTTL). They are specified in compliance with JEDEC
standard no. 7A.

The 74HC/HCT175 have four edge-triggered, D-type
flip-flops with individual D inputs and both Q and Q
outputs.
The common clock (CP) and master reset (MR) inputs load
and reset (clear) all flip-flops simultaneously.
The state of each D input, one set-up time before the
LOW-to-HIGH clock transition, is transferred to the
corresponding output (Qn) of the flip-flop.
All Qn outputs will be forced LOW independently of clock
or data inputs by a LOW voltage level on the MR input.
The device is useful for applications where both the true
and complement outputs are required and the clock and
master reset are common to all storage elements.
