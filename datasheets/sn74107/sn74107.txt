The ' 107 contain two independent J - K flip - flops with individual J - K , clock , and direct clear inputs . The ' 107 is a positive pulse - triggered flip - flop . The J - K input data is loaded into the master while the clock is high and transferred to the slave and the outputs on the high - to- low clock transistion . For these devices the J and K inputs must be stable while the clock is high . The LS107A contain two independent negative - edge- triggered flip - flops . The J and K inputs must be stable prior to the high - to - low clock transition for predictable operation . When the clear is low , it overrides the clock and data inputs forcing the Q output low and the Q output high . The SN54107 and the SN54LS107A are characterized for operation over the full military temperature range of -55 째 C to 125 째 C . The SN74107 and the SN74LS107A are characterized for operation from 0 째 C to 70 째 C .
