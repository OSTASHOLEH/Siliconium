The 74ALS257 is a quad 2-input multiplexer which selects 4 bits of
data from one of two sources under the control of a common select
input (S). The output enable input (OE) is active when Low. When
OE is High, all of the outputs (Yn) are forced to a High impedance
state (3-State) regardless of all other input conditions.
Moving data from two registers to a common output bus is a typical
use of the 74ALS257. The state of the select input determines the
particular register from which data comes.
The device is the logic implementation of 4-pole, 2-position switch
where the position of the switch is determined by the logic levels
supplied to the select input. The 74ALS258 is similar but has
inverting outputs (Yn).
