These d - c triggered multivibrators feature output pulse- duration control by three methods . The basic pulse time is programmed by selection of external resistance and capacitance values ( see typical application data ) . The 122 and LS122 have internal timing resistors that allow the circuits to be used with only an external capacitor , if so desired . Once triggered , the basic pulse duration may be extended by retriggering the gated low - level - active ( A ) or high - level - active ( B ) inputs , or be reduced by use of the overriding clear . Figure 1 illustrates pulse control by retriggering and early clear . The LS122 and LS123 are provided enough Schmitt hysteresis to ensure jitter - free triggering from the B input with transition rates as slow as 0.1 millivolt per nanosecond .
