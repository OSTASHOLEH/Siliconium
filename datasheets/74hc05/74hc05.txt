The M54/74HC05 is a high speed CMOS HEX
OPEN DRAIN INVERTER fabricated in silicon gate
C2

MOS technology. It has the same highspeed per-
formance of LSTTL combined with true CMOS low

power consumption.

The internal circuit is composed of 3 stages includ-
ing buffer output, which enables high noise im-
munity and stable output. All inputs are equipped

with circuits against static discharge and transient
excess voltage.
