These universal , monolithic , 9 bit ( 8 data bits plus 1 parity bit ) parity generators / checkers , utilize familiar Series 54/74 TTL circuitry and feature odd / even outputs and control inputs to facilitate operation in either odd or even - parity applications . Depending on whether even or odd parity is being generated or checked , the even or odd inputs can be utilized as the parity or 9th bit input . The word length capability is easily expanded by cascading . The SN54180 / SN74180 are fully compatible with other TTL or DTL circuits . Input buffers are provided so that each data input represents only one normalized series 54/74 load . A full fan - out to 10 normalized series 54/74 loads is available from each of the outputs at a low logic level . A fan out to 20 normalized loads is provided at a high logic level to facilitate the connection of unused inputs to used inputs . Typical power dissipation is 170 mW . The SN54180 is characterized for operation over the full military temperature range of -55 째 C to 125 째 C ; and the SN74180 is characterized for operation from 0 째 C to 70 째 C .
