These monolithic data selectors / multiplexers contain full on - chip binary decoding to select the desired data source . The ' 150 selects one - of - sixteen data sources ; the ' 151A , ' L $ 151 , and ' $ 151 select one - of - eight data sources . The ' 150 , ' 151A , ' LS151 , and ' S151 have a strobe input which must be at a low logic level to enable these devices . A high level at the strobe forces the W output high , and the Y output ( as applicable ) low . The 150 has only an inverted W output ; the ' 151A , ' LS151 , and ' $ 151 feature complementary W and Y outputs . The ' 151A and ' 152A incorporate address buffers that have symmetrical propagation delay times through the complementary paths . This reduces the possibility of transients occurring at the output ( s ) due to changes made at the select inputs , even when the ' 151A outputs are enabled
