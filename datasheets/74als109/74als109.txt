The 74ALS109A is a dual positive edge-triggered JK-type flip-flop
featuring individual J, K, clock, set, and reset inputs; also true and
complementary outputs. Set (SD) and reset (RD) are asynchronous
active-Low inputs and operate independently of the clock (CP) input.
The J and K are edge-triggered inputs which control the state
changes of the flip-flops as described in the function table. Clock
triggering occurs at a voltage level and is not directly related to the
transition time of the positive-going pulse. The J and K inputs must
be stable just one setup time prior to the Low-to-High transition of
the clock for predictable operation. The JK design allows operation
as a D flip-flop by tying J and K inputs together. Although the clock
input is level sensitive, the positive transition of the clock pulse
between the 0.8V and 2.0V levels should be equal to or less than
the clock to output delay time for reliable operation.
