The 74HC/HCT123 are high-speed
Si-gate CMOS devices and are pin
compatible with low power Schottky
TTL (LSTTL). They are specified in
compliance with JEDEC standard no.
7A.
The 74HC/HCT123 are dual
retriggerable monostable
multivibrators with output pulse width
control by three methods. The basic
pulse time is programmed by
selection of an external resistor
(REXT) and capacitor (CEXT). The
external resistor and capacitor are
normally connected as shown in
Fig.6.
Once triggered, the basic output
pulse width may be extended by
retriggering the gated active
LOW-going edge input (nA) or the
active HIGH-going edge input (nB).
By repeating this process, the output
pulse period (nQ = HIGH, nQ = LOW)
can be made as long as desired.
Alternatively an output delay can be
terminated at any time by a
LOW-going edge on input nRD, which
also inhibits the triggering.
An internal connection from nRD to
the input gates makes it possible to
trigger the circuit by a positive-going
signal at input nRD as shown in the
function table. Figures 7 and 8
illustrate pulse control by retriggeringand early reset. The basic output
pulse width is essentially determined
by the values of the external timing
components REXT and CEXT. For
pulse widths, when CEXT < 10 000 pF,
see Fig.9.
When CEXT > 10 000 pF, the typical
output pulse width is defined as:
tW = 0.45 × REXT × CEXT (typ.),

where:
tW = pulse width in ns;
REXT = external resistor in kΩ;
CEXT = external capacitor in pF.
Schmitt-trigger action in the nA and
nB inputs, makes the circuit highly
tolerant to slower input rise and fall
times.
The ‘123’ is identical to the ‘423’ but
can be triggered via the reset input.
