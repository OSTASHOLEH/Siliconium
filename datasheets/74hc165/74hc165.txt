The 74HC/HCT165 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS devices
and are pin compatible with low power Schottky TTL
(LSTTL). They are specified in compliance with JEDEC
standard no. 7A.
The 74HC/HCT165 are 8-bit parallel-load or serial-in shift
registers with complementary serial outputs (Q7 and
Q7) available from the last stage. When the parallel load
(PL) input is LOW, parallel data from the D0 to
D7 inputs are loaded into the register asynchronously.

When PL is HIGH, data enters the register serially at the
Ds input and shifts one place to the right
(Q0 → Q1 → Q2, etc.) with each positive-going clock
transition. This feature allows parallel-to-serial converter
expansion by tying the Q7 output to the DS input of the
succeeding stage.
The clock input is a gated-OR structure which allows one
input to be used as an active LOW clock enable (CE) input.
The pin assignment for the CP and CE inputs is arbitrary
and can be reversed for layout convenience. The
LOW-to-HIGH transition of input CE should only take
place while CP HIGH for predictable operation. Either the
CP or the CE should be HIGH before the
LOW-to-HIGH transition of PL to prevent shifting the data
when PL is activated.
