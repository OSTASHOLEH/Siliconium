The 74ALS138 decoder accepts three binary weighted inputs (A0,
A1, A2) and when enabled, provides eight mutually exclusive,
active-Low outputs (Q0 â€“ Q7). The device features three Enable
inputs; two active-Low (E0, E1) and one active-High (E2). Every
output will be High unless E0 and E1 are Low and E2 is High. This
multiple enable function allows easy parallel expansion of the device
to 1-of-32 (5 lines to 32 lines) decoder with just four 74ALS138s and
one inverter. The device can be used as an eight output
demultiplexer by using one of the active-Low Enable inputs as the
data input and the remaining Enable inputs as strobes. Enable
inputs not used must be permanently tied to their appropriate
active-High or active-Low state.
