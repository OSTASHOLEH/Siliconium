The ’165 and ’LS165A are 8-bit serial shift
registers that shift the data in the direction of QA
toward QH when clocked. Parallel-in access to
each stage is made available by eight individual,
direct data inputs that are enabled by a low level
at the shift/load (SH/LD) input. These registers
also feature gated clock (CLK) inputs and
complementary outputs from the eighth bit. All
inputs are diode-clamped to minimize
transmission-line effects, thereby simplifying
system design.
Clocking is accomplished through a two-input
positive-NOR gate, permitting one input to be
used as a clock-inhibit function. Holding either of
the clock inputs high inhibits clocking, and holding
either clock input low with SH/LD high enables the
other clock input. Clock inhibit (CLK INH) should
be changed to the high level only while CLK is
high. Parallel loading is inhibited as long as SH/LD
is high. Data at the parallel inputs are loaded
directly into the register while SH/LD is low,
independently of the levels of CLK, CLK INH, or
serial (SER) inputs.
