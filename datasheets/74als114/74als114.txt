The 74ALS112A, dual negative edge-triggered JK-type flip-flop
features individual J, K, clock (CPn), set (SD), and reset (RD)
inputs, true (Qn) and complementary (Qn) outputs.
The SD and RD inputs, when Low, set or reset the outputs as shown
in the function table regardless of the level at the other inputs.
A High level on the clock (CPn) input enables the J and K inputs and
data will be accepted. The logic levels at the J and K inputs may be
allowed to change while the CPn is High and the flip-flop will perform
according to the function table as long as minimum setup and hold
times are observed. Output changes are initiated by the High-to-Low
transition of the CPn.
