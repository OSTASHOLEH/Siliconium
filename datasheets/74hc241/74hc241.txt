The 74HC/HCT241 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS devices
and are pin compatible with low power Schottky TTL
(LSTTL). They are specified in compliance with JEDEC
standard no. 7A.
The 74HC/HCT241 are octal non-inverting buffer/line
drivers with 3-state outputs. The 3-state outputs are
controlled by the output enable inputs 1OE and 2OE.
