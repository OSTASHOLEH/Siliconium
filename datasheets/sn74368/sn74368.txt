These Hex buffers and line drivers are designed specifically to improve both the performance and density of three - state memory address drivers , clock drivers , and bus oriented receivers and transmitters . The designer has choice of selected combinations of inverting and noninverting outputs , symmetrical G ( active - low control ) inputs . These devices feature high fan - out , improved fan - in , and can be used to drive terminated lines down to 133 ohms . The SN54365A thru SN54368A and SN54LS365A thru SN54LS368A are characterized for operation over the full military temperature range of – 55 ° C to 125 ° C . The SN74365A thru SN74368A and SN74LS365A thru SN74LS368A are characterized for operation from 0 ° C to 70 ° C .
