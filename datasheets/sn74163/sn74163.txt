These synchronous , presettable counters feature an in- ternal carry look - ahead for application in high speed counting designs . The 160 , 162 LS160A LS162A , and S162 are decade counters and the 161 , 163 , LS161A , LS163A and S163 are 4 - bit binary counters Synchronous operation is provided by having all flip - flops clocked simultaneously so that the outputs change coincident with each other when so in structed by the count enable inputs and internal gating . This mode of operation eliminates the output counting spikes that are normally associated with asynchronous tripple clock counters , however counting spikes may occur on the ( RCO ) ripple carry output A buffered clock input triggers the four flip flops on the rising edge of the clock imput waveform . These counters are fully programmable : that is , the outputs may be preset to either level . As presetting is synchronous , set ting up a low level at the load input disables the counter and causes the outputs to agree with the setup data after the next clock pulse regardless of the levels of the enable inputs . Low to high transitions at the load input of the 7.60 thru 163 should be avoided when the clock is low if the enable inputs are high at or before the transition . This restriction is not applicable to the LS160A thru LS163A or S162 or ' S163 . The clear function for the 160 , 16 LS160A and LS161A is asynchronous and a low level at the clear input sets all four of the flip flop outputs low regardless of the levels of clock , load , or enable i puts . The clear function for the 162 , 163 , LS162A , LS163A $ 162 , and $ 163 is synchronous and a low level at the clear in put sets all four of the fip - flop outputs low after the next clock pulse , regardless of the levels of the enable inputs . This synt chronous clear allows the count length to be modified easily as decoding the maximum count desired can be accomplished with one external NAND gate The gate output is connected to the clear input to synchronously clear the counter to 0000 LLLLL Low - to - high transitions at the clear input of the 162 and 1163 should be avoided when the clock is low if the enable and load inputs are high at or before the transition
