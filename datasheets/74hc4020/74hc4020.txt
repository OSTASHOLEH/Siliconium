The 74HC/HCT4020 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS
devices and are pin compatible with the “4020” of the
“4000B” series. They are specified in compliance with
JEDEC standard no. 7A.

The 74HC/HCT4020 are 14-stage binary ripple counters
with a clock input (CP), an overriding asynchronous
master reset input (MR) and twelve fully buffered parallel
outputs (Q0, Q3 to Q13).
The counter is advanced on the HIGH-to-LOW transition of
CP.
A HIGH on MR clears all counter stages and forces all
outputs LOW, independent of the state of CP.
Each counter stage is a static toggle flip-flop.
