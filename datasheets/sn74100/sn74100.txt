These latches are ideally suited for use as temporary storage for binary information between processing units and input / output or indicator units . Information present at a data ( D ) input is transferred to the Q output when the enable ( G ) is high and the Q output will follow the data input as long as the enable remains high . When the enable goes low , the information ( that was setup at the data input at the time the transition occurred ) is retained at the Q output until the enable is permitted to go high . These circuits are completely compatible with all popular TTL families . All inputs are diode - clamped to minimize transmission - line effects and simplify system design . Typical power dissipation is 40 milliwatts per latch . The SN54100 is characterized for operation over the full military temperature range of 55 to 125 ° C ; the SN74100 is characterized for operation from 0 ° C to 70 ° C .
