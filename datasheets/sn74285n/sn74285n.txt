These high - speed TTL circuits are designed to be used in high - performance parallel multiplication applica- tions . When connected as shown in Figure A , these circuits perform the positive - logic multiplication of two 4 - bit binary words . The eight - bit binary product is generated with typically only 40 nanoseconds delay . This basic four - by - four multiplier can be utilized as a fundamental building block for implementing larger multipliers . For example , the four - by - four building blocks can be connected as shown in Figure B to generate submultiple partial products . These results can then be summed in a Wallace tree , and , as illustrated , will produce a 16 - bit product for the two eight - bit words typically in 70 nanoseconds . SN54H183 / SN74H183 carry - save adders and SN54S181 / SN74S181 arithmetic logic units with the SN54S182 / SN745182 look - ahead generator are used to achieve this high performance . The scheme is expandable for implementing NX M bit multipliers . The SN54284 and SN54285 are characterized for operation over the full military temperature range of -55 째 C to 125 째 C ; the SN74284 and SN74285 are characterized for operation from 0 째 C to 70 째 C .
