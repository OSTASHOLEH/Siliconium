These four - bit magnitude comparators perform comparison of straight binary and straight BCD ( 8-4-2-1 ) codes . Three fully decoded decisions about two 4 - bit words ( A , B ) are made and are externally available at three outputs . These devices are fully expandable to any number of bits without external gates . Words of greater length may be compared by connecting comparators in cascade . The A > B , A < B , and A B outputs of a = stage handling less - Tignificant bits are connected to the corresponding A > B , A < B , and A = B inputs of the next stage handling more - significant bits . The stage handling the least - significant bits must have a high - level voltage applied to the A = B input . The cascading paths of the '85 , LS85 , and ' S85 are implemented with only a two - gate - level delay to reduce overall comparison times for long words . An alternate method of cascading which further reduces the comparison time is shown in the typical application data .
