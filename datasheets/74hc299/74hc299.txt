The 74HC/HCT299 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS devices
and are pin compatible with low power Schottky TTL
(LSTTL). They are specified in compliance with JEDEC
standard no. 7A.

The 74HC/HCT299 contain eight edge-triggered D-type
flip-flops and the interstage logic necessary to perform
synchronous shift-right, shift-left, parallel load and hold
operations. The type of operation is determined by the
mode select inputs (S0 and S1), as shown in the mode
select table.
All flip-flop outputs have 3-state buffers to separate these
outputs (I/O0 to I/O7) such, that they can serve as data
inputs in the parallel load mode. The serial outputs (Q0 and
Q7) are used for expansion in serial shifting of longer
words.
A LOW signal on the asynchronous master reset input
(MR) overrides the Sn and clock (CP) inputs and resets the
flip-flops. All other state changes are initiated by the rising
edge of the clock pulse. Inputs can change when the clock
is either state, provided that the recommended set-up and
hold times, relative to the rising edge of CP, are observed.
A HIGH signal on the 3-state output enable inputs (OE1 or
OE2) disables the 3-state buffers and the I/On outputs are
set to the high-impedance OFF-state. In this condition, the
shift, hold, load and reset operations can still occur. The
3-state buffers are also disabled by HIGH signals on both
S0 and S1, when in preparation for a parallel load
operation.
