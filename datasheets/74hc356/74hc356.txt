The 74HC/HCT356 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS devices
and are pin compatible with low power Schottky TTL

(LSTTL). They are specified in compliance with JEDEC
standard no. 7A.
The 74HC/HCT356 data selectors/multiplexers contain full
on-chip binary decoding, to select one-of-eight data
sources. The data select address is stored in transparent
latches that are enabled by a LOW on the latch enable
input LE.
Data on the 8 input lines (D0 to D7) is clocked into a
edge-triggered data register by a LOW-to-HIGH transition
of the clock (CP).
When the output enable input OE1 = HIGH, OE2 = HIGH
or OE3 = LOW, the outputs go to the high impedance
OFF-state.
Operation of these output enable inputs does not affect the
state of the latches and register.
