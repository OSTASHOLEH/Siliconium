The SN54110 and SN74110 are d - c coupled , variable- skew , J - K flips - flops which utilize TTL circuitry to ob tain 25 - MHz performance typically . They are termed " variable - skew " because they allow the maximum clock skew in a system to be a direct function of the clock pulse width . The J and K inputs are enabled only during a short period ( 20 nanoseconds maximum setup time plus 5 nanoseconds maximum hold time ) on the rising edge of the clock pulse . After this , inputs may be changed while the clock is the at high level without af fecting the state of the master . On the threshold level of the falling edge of the clock pulse , the data stored in the master during the rising edge will be transferred to the output . The effective allowable clock skew then is minimum propagation delay time minus hold time , plus clock pulse width . This means that the system designer can set the maximum allowable clock skew needed by varying the clock pulse width . Thus system design is made easier and the requirements for sophisticated clock distribution systems are minimized or , in some cases , entirely eliminated . These flip - flops have an addi tional feature the synchronous input has reduced sen sitivity to data change while the clock is high because the data need be present for only a short period of time and the system's susceptability to noise is thereby effec tively reduced . The SN54110 / SN74110 has the same functional advan tage as the SN5472 / SN7472 in that three - input AND logic is provided for both the J and K data functions . Preset and clear inputs , which are completely indepen dent of the state of the clock , are also provided . The SN54110 is characterized for operation over the full military temperature range of 55 째 C to 125 째 C : the SN74110 is characterized for operation from 0 째 C to 70 째 C
