The 74HC/HCT280 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS devices
and are pin compatible with low power Schottky TTL
(LSTTL). They are specified in compliance with JEDEC
standard no. 7A.
The 74HC/HCT280 are 9-bit parity generators or checkers
commonly used to detect errors in high-speed data

transmission or data retrieval systems. Both even and odd
parity outputs are available for generating or checking
even or odd parity up to 9 bits.
The even parity output (∑E) is HIGH when an even number
of data inputs (I0 to I8) are HIGH. The odd parity output (∑0)
is HIGH when an odd number of data inputs are HIGH.
Expansion to larger word sizes is accomplished by tying
the even outputs (∑E) of up to nine parallel devices to the
data inputs of the final stage. For a single-chip 16-bit
even/odd parity generator/checker, see
PC74HC/HCT7080.
