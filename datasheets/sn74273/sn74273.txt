These monolithic, positive-edge-triggered flip-
flops utilize TTL circuitry to implement D-type

flip-flop logic with a direct clear input.
Information at the D inputs meeting the setup time
requirements is transferred to the Q outputs on the
positive-going edge of the clock pulse. Clock
triggering occurs at a particular voltage level and
is not directly related to the transition time of the
positive-going pulse. When the clock input is at
either the high or low level, the D input signal has
no effect ar the output.
These flip-flops are guaranteed to respond to
clock frequencies ranging form 0 to 30 megahertz
while maximum clock frequency is typically 40
megahertz. Typical power dissipation is 39
milliwatts per flip-flop for the ′273 and 10 milliwatts
for the ′LS273.
