The 74HC/HCT4067 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS
devices and are pin compatible with the “4067” of the
“4000B” series. They are specified in compliance with
JEDEC standard no. 7A.

The 74HC/HCT4067 are 16-channel analog
multiplexers/demultiplexers with four address inputs (S0 to
S3) , an active LOW enable input (E), sixteen independent
inputs/outputs (Y0 to Y15) and a common input/output (Z).
The ”4067” contains sixteen bidirectional analog switches,
each with one side connected to an independent
input/output (Y0 to Y15) and the other side connected to a
common input/output (Z).
With E LOW, one of the sixteen switches is selected (low
impedance ON-state) by S0 to S3. All unselected switches
are in the high impedance OFF-state. With E HIGH, all
switches are in the high impedance OFF-state,
independent of S0 to S3.
The analog inputs/outputs (Y0 to Y15, and Z) can swing
between VCC as a positive limit and GND as a negative
limit. VCC to GND may not exceed 10 V.
