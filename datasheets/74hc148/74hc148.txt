The M54/74HC148 is a high speed CMOS 8-TO-3
LINE PRIORITY ENCODER fabricated in silicon
gate C2
MOS technology.
It has the same high speed performance for LSTTL
combined with true CMOS low power consumption.
The M54/74HC148 encodes eight data lines to
three-line (4-2-1) binary (octal). Cascading circuitry
(enable input EI and enable output EO) has been
provided to allow octal expansion without the need
for external circuitry. Data inputs are active at the
low logic level.
All inputs are equipped with protection circuits

against static discharge and transient excess volt-
age.
