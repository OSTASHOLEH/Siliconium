The 74HC/HCT182 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS devices
and are pin compatible with low power Schottky TTL
(LSTTL). They are specified in compliance with JEDEC
standard no. 7A.
The 74HC/HCT182 carry look-ahead generators accept
up to four pairs of active LOW carry propagate (P0, P1, P2,
P3) and carry generate (G0, G1, G2, G3) signals and an
active HIGH carry input (Cn). The devices provide

anticipated active HIGH carries (Cn+x, Cn+y, Cn+z) across
four groups of binary adders.
The “182” also has active LOW carry propagate (P) and
carry generate (G) outputs which may be used for further
levels of look-ahead.
The logic equations provided at the outputs are:
Cn+x = G0 + P0Cn
Cn+y = G1 + P1G0 + P1P0Cn
Cn+z = G2 + P2G1 + P2P1G0 + P2P1P0Cn

The “182” can also be used with binary ALU’s in an active
LOW or active HIGH input operand mode. The
connections to and from the ALU to the carry look-ahead
generator are identical in both cases.
