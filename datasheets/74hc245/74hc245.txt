The 74HC245; 74HCT245 is a high-speed Si-gate CMOS device and is pin compatible
with Low-Power Schottky TTL (LSTTL).
The 74HC245; 74HCT245 is an octal transceiver featuring non-inverting 3-state bus
compatible outputs in both send and receive directions. The 74HC245; 74HCT245
features an output enable input (OE) for easy cascading and a send/receive input (DIR)
for direction control. OE controls the outputs so that the buses are effectively isolated.
The 74HC245; 74HCT245 is similar to the 74HC640; 74HCT640 but has true
(non-inverting) outputs.
