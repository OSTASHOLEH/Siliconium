These devices contain four independent 2 - input Exclusive - OR gates . They perform the Boolean functions Y = A e B = AB + AB in positive logic . A common application is as a true / complement element . If one of the inputs is low , the other input will be reproduced in true form at the output . If one of the inputs is high , the signal on the other input will be reproduced inverted at the output .
