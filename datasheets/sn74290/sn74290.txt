the The SN54290 / SN74290 , SN54LS290 / SN74LS290 , SN54293 / SN74293 , and SN54LS293 / SN74LS293 counters are electrically and functionally identical to SN5490A / SN7490A , SN54LS90 / SN74LS90 , and SN54LS93 / SN74LS93 , respectively . Only the arrangement of the terminals has been changed for the ' 290 , ' LS290 , ' 293 , and LS293 . SN5493A / SN7493A , Each of these monolithic counters contains four master - slave flip - flops and additional gating to pro- vide a divide - by - two counter and a three - stage binary counter for which the count cycle length is divide- by - five for the ' 290 and LS290 and divide - by - eight for the ' 293 and ' LS293 . All of these counters have a gated zero reset and the 290 and LS290 also have gated set - to - nine inputs for use in BCD nine's complement applications . To use the maximum count length ( decade or four - bit binary ) of these counters , the B input is connected to the QA output . The input count pulses are applied to input A and the outputs are as described in the appropriate function table . A symmetrical divide - by- ten count can be obtained from the 290 and LS290 counters by connecting the Qp output to the A input and applying the input count to the B input which gives a divide - by - ten square wave at output QA
