The 74HC/HCT174 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS devices
and are pin compatible with low power Schottky TTL
(LSTTL). They are specified in compliance with JEDEC
standard no. 7A.

The 74HC/HCT174 have six edge-triggered D-type
flip-flops with individual D inputs and Q outputs. The
common clock (CP) and master reset (MR) inputs load and
reset (clear) all flip-flops simultaneously.
The register is fully edge-triggered. The state of each D
input, one set-up time prior to the LOW-to-HIGH clock
transition, is transferred to the corresponding output of the
flip-flop.
A LOW level on the MR input forces all outputs LOW,
independently of clock or data inputs.
The device is useful for applications requiring true outputs
only and clock and master reset inputs that are common to
all storage elements.
