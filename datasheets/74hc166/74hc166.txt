The 74HC/HCT166 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS devices
and are pin compatible with low power Schottky TTL
(LSTTL). They are specified in compliance with JEDEC
standard no. 7A.
The 74HC/HCT166 are 8-bit shift registers which have a
fully synchronous serial or parallel data entry selected by

an active LOW parallel enable (PE) input. When PE is
LOW one set-up time prior to the LOW-to-HIGH clock
transition, parallel data is entered into the register. When
PE is HIGH, data is entered into the internal bit position Q0
from serial data input (Ds), and the remaining bits are
shifted one place to the right (Q0 → Q1 → Q2, etc.) with
each positive-going clock transition.
This feature allows parallel-to-serial converter expansion
by tying the Q7 output to the Ds input of the succeeding
stage.
The clock input is a gated-OR structure which allows one
input to be used as an active LOW clock enable (CE) input.
The pin assignment for the CP and CE inputs is arbitrary
and can be reversed for layout convenience. The
LOW-to-HIGH transition of input CE should only take place
while CP is HIGH for predictable operation. A LOW on the
master reset (MR) input overrides all other inputs and
clears the register asynchronously, forcing all bit positions
to a LOW state.
