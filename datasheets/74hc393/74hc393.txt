The 74HC/HCT393 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS devices
and are pin compatible with low power Schottky TTL
(LSTTL). They are specified in compliance with JEDEC
standard no. 7A.

The 74HC/HCT393 are 4-bit binary ripple counters with
separate clocks (1CP and 2 CP) and master reset (1MR
and 2MR) inputs to each counter. The operation of each
half of the “393” is the same as the “93” except no external
clock connections are required.
The counters are triggered by a HIGH-to-LOW transition of
the clock inputs. The counter outputs are internally
connected to provide clock inputs to succeeding stages.
The outputs of the ripple counter do not change
synchronously and should not be used for high-speed
address decoding.
The master resets are active-HIGH asynchronous inputs
to each 4-bit counter identified by the “1” and “2” in the pin
description.
A HIGH level on the nMR input overrides the clock and
sets the outputs LOW.
