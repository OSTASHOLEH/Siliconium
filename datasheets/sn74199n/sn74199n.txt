These 8 - bit shift registers are compatible with most other TTL and MSI logic families . All inputs are buffered to lower the drive requirements to one normalized Series 54/74 load , and input clamping diodes minimize switching transients to simplify system design . Maximum input clock frequency is typically 35 megahertz and power dissipation is typically 360 mW . Series 54 devices are characterized for operation over the full military temperature range of -55 째 C to 125 째 C : Series 74 devices are characterized for operation from 0 째 C to 70 째 C .
