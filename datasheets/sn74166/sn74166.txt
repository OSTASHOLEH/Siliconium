The ' 166 and ' LS166A 8 - bit shift registers are compati- ble with most other TTL logic families . All ' 166 and LS166A inputs are buffered to lower the drive re- quirements to one Series 54/74 or Series 54LS / 74LS standard load , respectively . Input clamping diodes minimize switching transients and simplify system design . These parallel - in or serial - in , serial - out shift registers have a complexity of 77 equivalent gates on a monolithic chip . They feature gated clock inputs and an overriding clear input . The parallel - in or serial - in modes are established by the shift / load input . When high , this in- put enables the serial data input and couples the eight flip - flops for serial shifting with each clock pulse . When low , the parallel ( broadside ) data inputs are enabled and synchronous loading occurs on the next clock pulse . During parallel loading , serial data flow is inhibited . Clocking is accomplished on the low - to - high - level edge of the clock pulse through a two - input positive NOR gate permitting one input to be used as a clock - enable or clock - inhibit function . Holding either of the clock in- puts high inhibits clocking ; holding eitiler low enables the other clock input . This , of course , allows the system clock to be free - running and the register can be stopped on command with the other clock input . The clock in- hibit input should be changed to the high level only while the clock input is high . A buffered , direct clear in- put overrides all other inputs , including the clock , and sets all flip - flops to zero .
