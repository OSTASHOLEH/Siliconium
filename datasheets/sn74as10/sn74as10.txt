These devices contain three independent 3-input
positive-NAND gates. They perform the Boolean
functions Y = A • B • C or Y = A + B + C in positive
logic.
The SN54ALS10A and SN54AS10 are
characterized for operation over the full military
temperature range of –55°C to 125°C. The
SN74ALS10A and SN74AS10 are characterized
for operation from 0°C to 70°C.
