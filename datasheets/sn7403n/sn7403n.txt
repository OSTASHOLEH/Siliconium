These devices contain four independent 2 - input NAND gates . The open - collector outputs require pull - up resistors to perform correctly . They may be connected to other open - collector outputs to implement active - low wired - OR or active - high wired - AND functions . Open - collector devices are often used to generate higher VOH levels . The SN5403 . SN54LS03 , and SN54S03 are characterized for operation over the full military temperature range of -55 째 C to 125 째 C . The SN7403 , SN74LS03 , and S SN74S03 are characterized for operation from 0 째 C to 70 째 C .
