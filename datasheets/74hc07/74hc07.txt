The M74HC07 is an high speed CMOS HEX
OPEN DRAIN BUFFER fabricated with silicon
gate C2MOS technology.
The internal circuit is composed of 2 stages
including buffer output, which enables high noise
immunity and stable output.

All inputs are equipped with protection circuits
against static discharge and transient excess
voltage.
