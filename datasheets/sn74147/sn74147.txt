These TTL encoders feature priority decoding of the inputs to ensure that only the highest-order data line is
encoded. The ’147 and ’LS147 devices encode nine data lines to four-line (8-4-2-1) BCD. The implied decimal
zero condition requires no input condition, as zero is encoded when all nine data lines are at a high logic level.
The ’148 and ’LS148 devices encode eight data lines to three-line (4-2-1) binary (octal). Cascading circuitry
(enable input EI and enable output EO) has been provided to allow octal expansion without the need for external
circuitry. For all types, data inputs and outputs are active at the low logic level. All inputs are buffered to represent
one normalized Series 54/74 or 54/74LS load, respectively.
