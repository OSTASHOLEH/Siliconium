These quadruple TTL J - K flip - flops incorporate a number of third - generation IC features that can simplify system design and reduce flip - flop package count by as much as 50 % . They feature hysteresis at the clock input , fully buffered outputs , and direct clear capability . The positive - edge - triggered SN54376 and SN74376 are directly compatible with most Series 54/74 MSI registers . The SN54376 is characterized for operation over the full military temperature range of -55 째 C to 125 째 C ; the SN74376 is characterized for operation from 0 째 C to 70 째 C .
