The M54/74HC386 is a high speed CMOS QUAD
EXCLUSIVE-OR GATE fabricated in silicon gate
C2
MOS technology.
It has the same high speed performance of LSTTL
combined with true CMOS low power consumption.
An output buffer provides high noise immunity and
a stable output.
All inputs are equipped with protection circuits

against static discharge and transient excess volt-
age.
