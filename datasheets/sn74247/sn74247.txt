The ' 246 and 247 are electrically and functionally identical to the SN5446A / SN7446A , and SN5447A / SN7447A respectively , and have the same pin assignments as their equivalents . The ' LS247 and LS248 are electrically and functionally identical to the SN54LS47 / SN74LS47 and SN54LS48 / SN74LS48 , respectively , and have the same pin assignments as their equivalents . They can be used interchangeably in present or future designs to offer designers a choice between two indicator fonts . The ' 4BA , ' 47A , LS47 , and ' LS48 compose the band the without tails and the ' 246 , 247 , ' LS247 , and LS248 compose the 5 and the 9 with tails . Composition of all other characters , including display patterns for BCD inputs above nine , is identical . The ' 246. ' 247 , and LS247 feature active - low outputs designed for driving indicatois directly , and the LS248 features active - high outputs for driving lamp buffers . All of the circuits have full ripple - blanking input / output controls and a lamp test input . Segment identification and resultant displays are shown below . Display patterns for BCD input counts above 9 are unique symbols to authenticate input conditions . All of these circuits incorporate automatic leading and / or trailing - edge zero - blanking control ( RBI and RBO ) . Lamp test ( LT ) of these types may be performed at any time when the BI / RBO node is at a high level . All types contain an overriding blanking input ( BI ) which can be used to control the lamp intensity by pulsing or to inhibit the outputs . Inputs and outputs are entirely compatible for use with TTL logic outputs . Series 54 and Series 54LS devices are characterized for operation over the full military tamperature range of -55 째 C to 125 째 C ; Series 74 and Series 74LS devices are characterized for operation from 0 째 C to 70 째 C .
