These latches are ideally suited for use as temporary storage for binary information between processing units and input / output or indicator units . Information present at a data ( D ) input is transferred to the Q output when the enable ( C ) is high and the Q output will follow the data input as long as the enable remains high . When the enable goes low , the information ( that was present at the data input at the time the transition occurred ) is retained at the Q output until the enable is permitted to go high . The '75 and LS75 feature complementary Q and a outputs from a 4 - bit latch , and are available in various 16 - pin packages . For higher component density applications , the '77 and LS77 4 - bit latches are available in 14 - pin flat packages . These circuits are completely compatible with all popular TTL families . All inputs are diode - clamped to minimize transmission - line effects and simplify system design . Series 54 and 54LS devices are characterized for operation over the full military temperature range of -55 째 C to 125 째 C ; Series 74 , and 74LS devices are characterized for operation from 0 째 C to 70 째 C .
