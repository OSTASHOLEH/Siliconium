The 74HC/HCT240 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS devices
and are pin compatible with low power Schottky TTL
(LSTTL). They are specified in compliance with JEDEC
standard no. 7A.
The 74HC/HCT240 are octal inverting buffer/line drivers
with 3-state outputs. The 3-state outputs are controlled by
the output enable inputs 1OE and 2OE. A HIGH on nOE
causes the outputs to assume a high impedance
OFF-state. The “240” is identical to the “244” but has
inverting outputs.
