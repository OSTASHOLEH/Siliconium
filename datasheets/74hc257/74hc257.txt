The Harris CD74HC257 and CD74HCT257 are quad 2-input
multiplexers which select four bits of data from two sources
under the control of a common Select Input (S). The Output
Enable input (OE) is active LOW. When OE is HIGH, all of

the outputs (1Y-4Y) are in the high impedance state regard-
less of all other input conditions.

Moving data from two groups of registers to four common
output busses is a common use of the 257. The state of the
Select input determines the particular register from which
the data comes. It can also be used as a function generator.
