These TTL hex buffers/drivers feature
high-voltage open-collector outputs for interfacing
with high-level circuits (such as MOS) or for
driving high-current loads (such as lamps or
relays) and also are characterized for use as
buffers for driving TTL inputs. The SN5407 and
SN7407 have minimum breakdown voltages of
30 V, and the SN5417 and SN7417 have
minimum breakdown voltages of 15 V. The
maximum sink current is 30 mA for the SN5407
and SN5417 and 40 mA for the SN7407 and
SN7417.
These devices perform the Boolean function
Y = A in positive logic.
