These devices contain four independent 2-input
NAND buffer gates with open-collector outputs.
They perform the Boolean functions Y = A • B or
Y = A + B in positive logic.
The open-collector outputs require pullup
resistors to perform correctly. They may be
connected to other open-collector outputs to
implement active-low wired-OR or active-high
wired-AND functions. Open-collector devices are
often used to generate higher VOH levels.
The SN54F38 is characterized for operation over
the full military temperature range of –55°C to
125°C. The SN74F38 is characterized for
operation from 0°C to 70°C.
