These shift registers utilize fully d - c coupled storage elements and feature synchronous parallel inputs and parallel outputs . Parallel loading is accomplished by taking the shift input low , applying the four bits of data , and taking the load input high . The data is loaded into the associated flip - flop synchronously and appears at the outputs after a high to low transition of the clock . During loading , serial data flow is inhibited . Shift right is also accomplished on the falling edge of the clock pulse when the shift input is high regardless of the level of the load input . Serial data for this mode is entered at the serial data input . When both the shift and load inputs are low , clocking of the register can continue ; however , data appearing at each output is fed back to the flip - flop input creating a mode in which the data is held unchanged . Thus , the system clock may be left free - running without changing the contents of the register .
