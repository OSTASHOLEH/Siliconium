These octal bus transceivers are designed for
asynchronous communication between data
buses. The devices transmit data from the A bus
to the B bus or from the B bus to the A bus
depending upon the logic level at the
direction-control (DIR) input. The output enable
(OE) input can be used to disable the device so the
buses are effectively isolated.
The SN74F245 is available in TI’s shrink
small-outline package (DB), which provides the
same I/O pin count and functionality of standard
small-outline packages in less than half the
printed-circuit-board area.
The SN54F245 is characterized for operation over
the full military temperature range of –55°C to
125°C. The SN74F245 is characterized for
operation from 0°C to 70°C.
