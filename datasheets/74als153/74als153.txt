The 74ALS153 has two identical 4–input multiplexer with 3–State
outputs which selects two bits of data from four sources by using
common select inputs (S0, S1). The two 4–input multiplexer circuits
have individual active–Low enables (Ea, Eb) which can be used to
strobe the outputs independently. Outputs (Ya, Yb) are forced Low
when the corresponding enable is high.
The 74ALS153 is the logic implementation of a 2–pole, 4–position
switch where the position of the switch is determined by the logic
levels supplied to the common select inputs.
