The 74ALS241A is an octal buffer that is ideal for driving bus lines or
buffer memory address registers. The outputs are all capable of
sinking 24mA and sourcing up to 15mA, producing very good
capacitive drive characteristics. The device features two output
enables, OEa and OEb, each controlling four of the 3-State outputs.
The 74ALS241A-1 sinks 48mA IOL if the VCC is limited to
5.0V Â±0.25V.
