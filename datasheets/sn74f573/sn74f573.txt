These 8-bit latches feature 3-state outputs
designed specifically for driving highly capacitive
or relatively low-impedance loads. They are
particularly suitable for implementing buffer
registers, I/O ports, bidirectional bus drivers, and
working registers.
The eight latches of the ′F573 are transparent
D-type latches. While the latch enable (LE) input
is high, the Q outputs follow the data (D) inputs.
When the latch enable is taken low, the Q outputs
are latched at the logic levels set up at the D
inputs.
A buffered output enable (OE) input can be used
to place the eight outputs in either a normal logic

state (high or low logic levels) or a high-
impedance state. In the high-impedance state, the

outputs neither load nor drive the bus lines
significantly. The high-impedance state and
increased drive provide the capability to drive bus
lines without need for interface or pullup
components.
The output enable (OE) input does not affect the internal operations of the latches. Old data can be retained
or new data can be entered while the outputs are in the high-impedance state.
The SN54F573 is characterized for operation over the full military temperature range of –55°C to 125°C. The
SN74F573 is characterized for operation from 0°C to 70°C.
