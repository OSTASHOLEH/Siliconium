These monolithic , fully synchronous , programmable counters utilize Series 54/74 TTL circuitry to achieve 32 - megahertz typical maximum operating frequen- cies . These six - bit serial binary counters feature buffered clock , clear , and enable inputs to control the operation of the counter , and a strobe input to enable or inhibit the rate input / decoding AND - OR - INVERT gates . The outputs have additional gating for cascading and transferring unity - count rites .
