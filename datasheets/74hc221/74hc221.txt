The 74HC/HCT221 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS devices
and are pin compatible with low power Schottky TTL
(LSTTL). They are specified in compliance with JEDEC
standard no. 7A.
The 74HC/HCT221 are dual non-retriggerable monostable
multivibrators. Each multivibrator features an active
LOW-going edge input (nA) and an active HIGH-going
edge input (nB), either of which can be used as an enable
input.
Pulse triggering occurs at a particular voltage level and is
not directly related to the transition time of the input pulse.
Schmitt-trigger input circuitry for the nB inputs allow

jitter-free triggering from inputs with slow transition rates,
providing the circuit with excellent noise immunity.
Once triggered, the outputs (nQ, nQ) are independent of
further transitions of nA and nB inputs and are a function
of the timing components. The output pulses can be
terminated by the overriding active LOW reset inputs
(nRD). Input pulses may be of any duration relative to the
output pulse.
Pulse width stability is achieved through internal
compensation and is virtually independent of VCC and
temperature. In most applications pulse stability will only
be limited by the accuracy of the external timing
components.
The output pulse width is defined by the following
relationship:
tW = CEXTREXTIn2
tW = 0.7CEXTREXT
Pin assignments for the “221” are identical to those of the
“123” so that the “221” can be substituted for those
products in systems not using the retrigger by merely
changing the value of REXT and/or CEXT.
