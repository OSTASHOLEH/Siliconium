The 74HC4050 is a high-speed Si-gate CMOS device and
is pin compatible with the “4050” of the “4000B” series. It
is specified in compliance with JEDEC standard no. 7A.
The 74HC4050 provides six non-inverting buffers with a
modified input protection structure, which has no diode
connected to VCC. Input voltages of up to 15 V may

therefore be used. This feature enables the non-inverting
buffers to be used as logic level translators, which will
convert high level logic to low level logic, while operating
from a low voltage power supply. For example 15 V logic
(“4000B series”) can be converted down to 2 V logic.
The actual input switch level remains related to the VCC
and is the same as mentioned in the family characteristics.
