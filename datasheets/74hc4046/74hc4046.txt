The MC74HC4046A is similar in function to the MC14046 Metal
gate CMOS device. The device inputs are compatible with standard
CMOS outputs; with pullup resistors, they are compatible with
LSTTL outputs.
The HC4046A phase–locked loop contains three phase
comparators, a voltage–controlled oscillator (VCO) and unity gain
op–amp DEMOUT. The comparators have two common signal inputs,
COMPIN, and SIGIN. Input SIGIN and COMPIN can be used directly
coupled to large voltage signals, or indirectly coupled (with a series
capacitor to small voltage signals). The self–bias circuit adjusts small
voltage signals in the linear region of the amplifier. Phase comparator
1 (an exclusive OR gate) provides a digital error signal PC1OUT and
maintains 90 degrees phase shift at the center frequency between
SIGIN and COMPIN signals (both at 50% duty cycle). Phase
comparator 2 (with leading–edge sensing logic) provides digital error
signals PC2OUT and PCPOUT and maintains a 0 degree phase shift
between SIGIN and COMPIN signals (duty cycle is immaterial). The
linear VCO produces an output signal VCOOUT whose frequency is
determined by the voltage of input VCOIN signal and the capacitor
and resistors connected to pins C1A, C1B, R1 and R2. The unity gain
op–amp output DEMOUT with an external resistor is used where the
VCOIN signal is needed but no loading can be tolerated. The inhibit
input, when high, disables the VCO and all op–amps to minimize
standby power consumption.
Applications include FM and FSK modulation and demodulation,
frequency synthesis and multiplication, frequency discrimination,
tone decoding, data synchronization and conditioning,
voltage–to–frequency conversion and motor speed control.
