These octal buffers/drivers are designed
specifically to improve the performance and
density of 3-state memory address drivers, clock
drivers, and bus-oriented receivers and
transmitters. The designer has a choice of
selected combinations of inverting and
noninverting outputs, symmetrical active-low
output-enable (OE) inputs, and complementary
OE and OE inputs. These devices feature high
fan-out and improved fan-in.
The -1 version of SN74ALS241C is identical to the
standard version, except that the recommended
maximum IOL of the -1 version is 48 mA. There is
no -1 version of the SN54ALS241C.
The SN54ALS241C and SN54AS241A are
characterized for operation over the full military
temperature range of –55°C to 125°C. The
SN74ALS241C and SN74AS241A are
characterized for operation from 0°C to 70°C.
