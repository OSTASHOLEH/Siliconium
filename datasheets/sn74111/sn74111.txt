The SN54111 and SN74111 are d - c coupled , variable- skew , J - K flip - flops which utilize TTL circuitry to obtain 25 - MHz performance typically . They are termed " variable - skew " because they allow the maximum clock skew in a system to be a direct function of the clock pulse width . The J and K inputs are enabled to accept data only during a short period ( 30 nanoseconds max- imum hold time ) starting with , and immediately follow- ing the rising edge of the clock pulse . After this , inputs may be changed while the clock is at the high level without affecting the state of the master . At the threshold level of the falling edge of the clock pulse , the data stored in the master will be transferred to the out- put . The effective allowable clock skew then is minimum propagation delay time minus hold time , plus clock pulse width . This means that the system designer can set the maximum allowable clock skew needed by varying the clock pulse width . Thus system design is made easier and the requirements for sophisticated clock distribution systems are minimized or , in some cases , entirely eliminated . These flip - flops have an addi tional feature - the synchronous input has reduced sen- sitivity to data change while the clock is high because the data need be present for only a short period of time and the system's susceptibility to noise is thereby effec tively reduced . The SN54111 is characterized for operation over the full military temperature range of -55 째 C to 125 째 C ; the SN74111 is characterized for operation from 0 째 C to 70 째 C .
