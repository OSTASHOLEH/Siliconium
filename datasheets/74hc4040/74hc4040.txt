The 74HC4040; 74HCT4040 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS devices and are pin
compatible with the HEF4040B series. They are specified in compliance with JEDEC
standard no. 7A.
The 74HC4040; 74HCT4040 are 12-stage binary ripple counters with a clock input (CP),
an overriding asynchronous master reset input (MR) and twelve parallel outputs (Q0 to
Q11). The counter advances on the HIGH-to-LOW transition of CP.
A HIGH on MR clears all counter stages and forces all outputs LOW, independent of the
state of CP.
Each counter stage is a static toggle flip-flop.
