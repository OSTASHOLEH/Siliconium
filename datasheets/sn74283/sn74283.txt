The ' 283 and ' LS283 adders are electrically and functionally identical to the ' 83A and ' LS83A , respectively ; only the arrangement of the terminals has been changed . The ' S283 high performance versions are also functionally identical . These improved full adders perform the addition of two 4 - bit binary words . The sum ( Σ ) outputs are provided for each bit and the resultant carry ( C4 ) is obtained from the fourth bit . These adders feature full internal look - ahead across all four bits generating the carry term in ten nanoseconds , typically , for the 283 and LS283 , and 7.5 nanoseconds for the ' S283 . This capability provides the system designer with partial look - ahead performance at the economy and reduced package count of a ripple - carry implementation . The adder logic , including the carry , is implemented in its true form . End around carry can be accomplish- ed without the need for logic or level inversion . Series 54 , Series 54LS , and Series 54S circuits are characterized for operation over the full temperature range of -55 ° C to 125 ° C . Series 74 , Series 74LS , and Series 74S circuits are characterized for 0 ° C to 70 ° C operation .
