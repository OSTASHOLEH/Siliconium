The ′F257 is designed to multiplex signals from
4-bit data sources to 4-output data lines in
bus-organized systems. The 3-state outputs will
not load the data lines when the output enable
(OE) input is at a high logic level.
The SN54F257 is characterized for operation over
the full military temperature range of –55°C to
125°C. The SN74F257 is characterized for
operation from 0°C to 70°C.
