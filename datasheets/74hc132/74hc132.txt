The 74HC/HCT132 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS devices and are pin compatible with low power Schottky TTL (LSTTL).
They are specified in compliance with JEDEC standard no. 7A.
The 74HC/HCT132 contain four 2-input NAND gates which accept standard input signals. They are capable of
transforming slowly changing input signals into sharply defined, jitter-free output signals.
The gate switches at different points for positive and negative-going signals. The difference between the positive voltage
VT+ and the negative voltage VT− is defined as the hysteresis voltage VH.
