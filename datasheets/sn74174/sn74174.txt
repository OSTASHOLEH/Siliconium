These monolithic , positive - edge - triggered flip - flops utilize TTL circuitry to implement D - type flip - flop logic . All have a direct clear input , and the ' 175 , ' LS175 , and ' S175 feature complementary outputs from each flip- flop . Information at the D inputs meeting the setup time requirements is transferred to the Q outputs on the positive - going edge of the clock pulse . Clock triggering occurs at a particular voltage level and is not directly related to the transition time of the positive - going pulse . When the clock input is at either the high or low level , the D input signal has no effect at the output . These circuits are fully compatible for use with most TTL circuits .
