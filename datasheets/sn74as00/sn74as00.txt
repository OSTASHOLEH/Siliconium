These devices contain four independent 2-input
positive-NAND gates. They perform the Boolean
functions Y = A • B or Y = A + B in positive logic.
The SN54ALS00A and SN54AS00 are
characterized for operation over the full military
temperature range of –55°C to 125°C. The
SN74ALS00A and SN74AS00 are characterized
for operation from 0°C to 70°C.
