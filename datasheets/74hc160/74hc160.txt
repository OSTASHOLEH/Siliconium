The 74HC/HCT160 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS devices
and are pin compatible with low power Schottky TTL
(LSTTL). They are specified in compliance with JEDEC
standard no. 7A.
The 74HC/HCT160 are synchronous presettable decade
counters which feature an internal look-ahead carry and
can be used for high-speed counting.
Synchronous operation is provided by having all flip-flops
clocked simultaneously on the positive-going edge of the
clock (CP).
The outputs (Q0 to Q3) of the counters may be preset to a
HIGH or LOW level. A LOW level at the parallel enable

input (PE) disables the counting action and causes the
data at the data inputs (D0 to D3) to be loaded into the
counter on the positive-going edge of the clock (providing
that the set-up and hold time requirements for PE are met).
Preset takes place regardless of the levels at count enable
inputs (CEP and CET).
A LOW level at the master reset input (MR) sets all four
outputs of the flip-flops (Q0 to Q3) to LOW level regardless
of the levels at CP, PE, CET and CEP inputs (thus
providing an asynchronous clear function).
The look-ahead carry simplifies serial cascading of the
counters. Both count enable inputs (CEP and CET) must
be HIGH to count. The CET input is fed forward to enable
the terminal count output (TC). The TC output thus
enabled will produce a HIGH output pulse of a duration
approximately equal to a HIGH level output of Q0. This
pulse can be used to enable the next cascaded stage.
