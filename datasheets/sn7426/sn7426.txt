These 8 - bit addressable latches are designed for general purpose storage applications in digital systems . Specific uses include working registers , serial - holding registers , and active - high decoders or demultiplexers . They are multifunctional devices capable of storing single - line data in eight addressable latches , and being a 1 - of - 8 decoder or demultiplexer with active - high outputs . Four distinct modes of operation are selectable by con- trolling the clear ( CLR ) and enable ( G ) inputs as enumerated in the function table . In the addressable- latch mode , data at the data - in terminal is written into the addressed latch . The addressed latch will follow the data input with all unaddressed latches remaining in their previous states . In the memory mode , all latches remain in their previous states and are unaffected by the data or address inputs . To eliminate the possiblity of entering erroneous data in the latches , enable G should be held high ( inactive ) while the address lines are chang- ing . In the 1 - of - 8 decoding or demultiplexing mode , the addressed output will follow the level of the D input with all other outputs low . In the clear mode , all outputs are low and unaffected by the address and data inputs .
