This data selector/multiplexer contains inverters
and drivers to supply full binary decoding data
selection to the AND-OR-invert gates. Separate
output-enable (OE) inputs are provided for each of
the two 4-line sections.
The 3-state outputs can interface with and drive data lines of bus-organized systems. With all but one of the
common outputs disabled (at the high-impedance state), the low impedance of the single enabled output drives
the bus line to a high or low logic level. Each section has its own output enable. The output is disabled when
OE is high.
The SN74ALS353B is characterized for operation from 0°C to 70°C.
