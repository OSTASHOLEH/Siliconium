The 74HC164; 74HCT164 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS devices and are pin compatible
with Low power Schottky TTL (LSTTL). They are specified in compliance with JEDEC
standard no. 7A.
The 74HC164; 74HCT164 are 8-bit edge-triggered shift registers with serial data entry
and an output from each of the eight stages. Data is entered serially through one of two
inputs (DSA or DSB); either input can be used as an active HIGH enable for data entry
through the other input. Both inputs must be connected together or an unused input must
be tied HIGH.
Data shifts one place to the right on each LOW-to-HIGH transition of the clock (CP) input
and enters into Q0, which is the logical AND of the two data inputs (DSA and DSB) that
existed one set-up time prior to the rising clock edge.
A LOW level on the master reset (MR) input overrides all other inputs and clears the
register asynchronously, forcing all outputs LOW.
