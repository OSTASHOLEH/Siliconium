These octal buffers and line drivers are designed
specifically to improve both the performance and
density of 3-state memory address drivers, clock

drivers, and bus-oriented receivers and transmit-
ters. Taken together with the ’ALS240A,

’ALS241A, ’AS240, and ’AS241, these devices
provide the choice of selected combinations of
inverting outputs, symmetrical G (active-low input
control) inputs, and complementary G and G
inputs.
The –1 version of the SN74ALS244B is identical
to the standard version except that the
recommended maximum IOL is increased to
48 mA. There is no –1 version of the
SN54ALS244B.
The SN54ALS244B and SN54AS244 are characterized for operation over the full military temperature range
of –55°C to 125°C. The SN74ALS244B and SN74AS244 are characterized for operation from 0°C to 70°C.
