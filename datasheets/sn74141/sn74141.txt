The SN74141 is a second - generation BCD - to - decimal decoder designed specifically to drive cold - cathode indicator tubes . This decoder demonstrates an improved capability to minimize switching transients in order to maintain a stable display . Full decoding is provided for all possible input states . For binary inputs 10 through 15 , all the outputs are off . Therefore the SN74141 , combined with a mini- mum of external circuitry , can use these invalid codes in blanking leading and / or trailing - edge zeros in a display . The ten high - performance , n - p - n output tran- sistors have a maximum reverse current of 50 micro- amperes at 55 volts . Low - forward - impedance diodes are also provided for each input to clamp negative voltage transitions in order to minimize transmission - line effects . Power dissipation is typically 80 milliwatts . The SN74141 is characterized for operation over the temperature range of 0 ° C to 70 ° C .
