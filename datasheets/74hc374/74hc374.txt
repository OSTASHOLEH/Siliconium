The 74HC/HCT374 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS devices
and are pin compatible with low power Schottky TTL
(LSTTL). They are specified in compliance with JEDEC
standard no. 7A.

The 74HC/HCT374 are octal D-type flip-flops featuring
separate D-type inputs for each flip-flop and 3-state
outputs for bus oriented applications. A clock (CP) and an
output enable (OE) input are common to all flip-flops.
The 8 flip-flops will store the state of their individual
D-inputs that meet the set-up and hold times requirements
on the LOW-to-HIGH CP transition.
When OE is LOW, the contents of the 8 flip-flops are
available at the outputs. When OE is HIGH, the outputs go
to the high impedance OFF-state. Operation of the
OE input does not affect the state of the flip-flops.
The “374” is functionally identical to the “534”, but has
non-inverting outputs.
