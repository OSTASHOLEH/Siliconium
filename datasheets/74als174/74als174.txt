The 74ALS174 has six edge-triggered D-type flip-flops with
individual D inputs and Q outputs. The common buffered clock (CP)
and master reset (MR) inputs load and reset (clear) all flip-flops
simultaneously.
The register is fully edge-triggered. The state of each D input, one
setup time before the Low-to-High clock transition is transferred to
the corresponding flip-flopâ€™s Q output.
All Q outputs will be forced Low independent of clock or data inputs
by a Low voltage level on the MR input. The device is useful for
applications where true outputs only are required, and the clock and
master reset are common to all storage elements.
