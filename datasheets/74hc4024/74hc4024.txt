The 74HC/HCT4024 are high-speed Si-gate CMOS
devices and are pin compatible with the “4024” of the
“4000B” series. They are specified in compliance with
JEDEC standard no. 7A.
The 74HC/HCT4024 are 7-stage binary ripple counters
with a clock input (CP), an overriding asynchronous
master reset input (MR) and seven fully buffered parallel
outputs (Q0 to Q6).

The counter advances on the HIGH-to-LOW transition of
CP.
A HIGH on MR clears all counter stages and forces all
outputs LOW, independent of the state of CP.
Each counter stage is a static toggle flip-flop.
Schmitt-trigger action in the clock input makes the circuit
highly tolerant to slower clock rise and fall times.
