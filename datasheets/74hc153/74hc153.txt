The 74HC/HCT153 are high-speed
Si-gate CMOS devices and are pin
compatible with low power Schottky
TTL (LSTTL). They are specified in
compliance with JEDEC standard
no. 7A.

The 74HC/HCT153 have two
identical 4-input multiplexers which
select two bits of data from up to four
sources selected by common data
select inputs (S0, S1). The two 4-input
multiplexer circuits have individual
active LOW output enable inputs (1E,
2E) which can be used to strobe the
outputs independently. The outputs
(1Y, 2Y) are forced LOW when the
corresponding output enable inputs
are HIGH.
The “153” is the logic implementation
of a 2-pole, 4-position switch, where
the position of the switch is
determined by the logic levels applied
to S0 and S1.

The logic equations for the outputs
are:
1Y = 1E.(1I0.S1.S0+1I1.S1.S0+
+1I2.S1.S0+1I3.S1.S0)
2Y = 2E.(2I0.S1.S0+2I1.S1.S0+
+2I2.S1.S0+2I3.S1.S0)
The “153” can be used to move data
to a common output bus from a group
of registers. The state of the select
inputs would determine the particular
register from which the data came. An
alternative application is a function
generator. The device can generate
two functions or three variables. This
is useful for implementing highly
irregular random logic.
The “153” is similar to the “253” but
has standard outputs.
