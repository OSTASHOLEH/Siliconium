These monolithic circuits are synchronous reversible ( up / down ) counters having a complexity of 55 equivalent gates . The ' 192 and ' LS192 circuits are BCD counters and the ' 193 and ' LS193 are 4 - bit binary counters . Synchronous operation is provided by having all flip - flops clocked simultaneously so that the outputs change coincidently with each other when so instructed by the steering logic . This mode of operation eliminates the output counting spikes which are normally associated with asynchronous ( ripple- clock ) counters . The outputs of the four master - slave flip - flops are trig- gered by a low - to - high - level transition of either count ( clock ) input . The direction of counting is determined by which count input is pulsed while the other count input is high .
