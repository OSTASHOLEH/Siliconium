These octal buffers and line drivers are designed
to have the performance of the popular
SN54ALS240A/SN74ALS240A series and, at
the same time, offer a pinout with inputs and
outputs on opposite sides of the package. This
arrangement greatly facilitates printed circuit
board layout.
The 3-state control gate is a 2-input NOR gate
such that, if either output-enable (OE1 or OE2)
input is high, all eight outputs are in the
high-impedance state.
The SN74ALS540 provides inverted data. The
â€™ALS541 provide true data at the outputs.
The -1 versions of SN74ALS540 and
SN74ALS541 are identical to the standard
versions, except that the recommended
maximum IOL is increased to 48 mA. There is no
-1 version of the SN54ALS541.
